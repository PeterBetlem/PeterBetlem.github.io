    <h2>
        Hello!
    </h2>
    <p>
        My name is Peter, and I am currently a PhD Candidate working at the University Centre of Svalbard (UNIS).
    </p>
    <p>
        I apply numbers and programmatic solutions to geoscientific challenges, whether through 
        numerical models, structure-from-motion photogrammetry, GIS or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>

        My PhD targets the imaging of fluid migration pathways in caprock and overburden.
        The project builds upon the Longyearbyen CO2 Lab, a pilot CO2 sequestration project in Longyearbyen, Svalbard
        and contributes to the Norwegian CCS Research Centre.
        A large component of the work deals with the quantitative characterisation of 3D digital outcrop models 
        in Svalbard and elsewhere, and I am one of the co-creators of the <a href="#projects=svalbox">Svalbox project</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prior to starting my PhD in Longyearbyen I completed a MSc in Sustainable Energy at the University of Reykjavik, 
        and before that an MSc in Molecular Chemistry at Radboud University, The Netherlands.
    </p>
