        Hello!
    </h2>
    <p>
        My name is Peter, and I recently graduated with a PhD degree from the University Centre of Svalbard (UNIS) 
        and the University of Oslo (UiO). The PhD thesis and more information is available at the <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10852/105611">UiO:DUO Research Archive</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also one of the co-founders behind <a href="https://geomonkey.no">GeoMonkey AS</a>, a geospatial-oriented startup working with unmanned aerial vehicles, 
        geospatial data bases/-portals/-sets, and quantitative videography. Feel free to send me a message if you want to know more.
    </p>
    <p>
        I apply numbers and programmatic solutions to geoscientific challenges, whether through 
        numerical models, structure-from-motion photogrammetry, GIS or otherwise.
    </p>

        My PhD targeted the imaging of fluid migration pathways in cap rock and overburden.
        The project builds upon the Longyearbyen CO2 Lab, a pilot CO2 sequestration project in Longyearbyen, Svalbard
        and contributes to the Norwegian CCS Research Centre.
        A large component of the work deals with the quantitative characterisation of 3D digital outcrop models 
        in Svalbard and elsewhere, and I am one of the co-creators and current digital data lead of the <a href="#projects=svalbox">Svalbox project</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prior to starting my PhD in Longyearbyen I completed a MSc in Sustainable Energy at the University of Reykjavik, 
        and before that an MSc in Molecular Chemistry at Radboud University, The Netherlands.
