		"abstract": "Methane is the most widespread volatile hydrocarbon and one of the most potent greenhouse gases. Marine sediments form the largest methane reservoir, from where large quantities of methane from gas-saturated sediments are released into the sea water and into the shallow shelf seas, through the water column almost unaltered into the atmosphere. Craters on the sea floor known as pockmarks are often related to seepage of methane-rich fluids originating either from shallow (microbial) or deep (thermogenic) sources. This paper presents the geochemical characteristics of migrating hydrocarbon gas from selected pockmarks and surrounding seabed in Isfjorden and Mohnbukta in western and eastern Spitsbergen, respectively. Collected gas samples, including wet gas fraction, were analyzed for methane concentration and methane carbon stable isotope ratio. Mixtures of microbial and thermogenic methane, together with higher homologies were found in the pockmarks as well as in the adjacent undisturbed seafloor, suggesting that the seepage activity in both areas is currently on the same level. Although the methane concentration profiles and methane stable carbon isotope ratios in Isfjorden and Mohnbukta show signs of biological oxidation and elevated concentrations of ethane/propane indicate input from deeper thermogenic sources. The gas composition and methane carbon stable isotope ratio from Isfjorden and Mohnbukta areas show similar trends, most likely due to originating in the same Mesozoic organic-rich marine mudstone.",

		"abstract": "This study analyses pockmark morphology and their spatial distribution in Isfjorden relative to seabed morphology, bedrock geology, fault systems, glacial landforms and processes using multibeam bathymetric data. It provides insight into the possible mechanisms of pockmark formation, high density pockmark field evolution, and fluid migration pathways. A total of 1304 pockmarks occur in the Isfjorden at water depths of 40 to 320m, varying from circular to elongate in plan-view. Their diameter ranges from 14 to 265m and their depths from 1 to 11m. Elongate pockmarks are dominant in the Isfjordbanken and outer Isfjorden where the seafloor is influenced by the West Spitsbergen Current. The West Spitsbergen fold-and-thrust belt and other fault systems sub-cropping at the Isfjorden seafloor correlate spatially with the high density pockmark zones. The pockmarks are preferentially located on the marine sediments draping the bedrock of Isfjorden fjord system. They are most abundant in the areas underlain by Jurassic–Cretaceous and the Triassic–Lower Jurassic bedrock. Pockmarks found ahead of submarine slope failures may have formed due to dewatering of soft sediments as a result of rapid increase of overpressure caused by deposition of glacigenic debris lobes. Fault conduits, potential source rock and thin postglacial sediment layers are found to be crucial for the formation of pockmarks. Modeling results of the near-shore subsea permafrost and potential gas hydrate stability zone imply thawing permafrost and gas hydrate dissociation as additional possible mechanisms for pockmark formation in Isfjorden.",

		"abstract": "This study integrates high-resolution shallow- and deep-geophysical datasets to study the seabed seepage systems linked to subsurface shallow gas and geological features influencing the fluid flow in Nordfjorden, central Spitsbergen (Arctic Norway). This is one of the tributary fjords of the Isfjorden fjord system in Spitsbergen which has the highest density of pockmarks ranging up to 20/km2. The 535 pockmarks identified manually in the 300 km2 large study area have diameters ranging from 10 m to 212 m, and depth varying between 1 m and 8 m. Sub-surface seep-related acoustic features such as, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking and turbidity zones recorded on 55 km of new high-resolution sub-bottom acoustic data suggest shallow gas (free and/or dissolved) occurrences in the marine sediments beneath the pockmarks. Structural features (thrust faults and associated folds) belonging to the Palaeogene West Spitsbergen fold-and-thrust belt and Early Cretaceous igneous sills have been interpreted on 2D multichannel seismic data, in the Triassic and Permian successions. Some of these faults and igneous sills form seafloor ridges, where pockmark density is high, and they are typically aligned. Acoustic flares attributed to active gas seepage from the seafloor were imaged in the water column in the southern part of Nordfjorden, above the sub-surface shallow gas occurrences and thrust faults. The integrated analysis of these geophysical datasets suggests that the near-seafloor tectonically deformed stratum plays an important role in the up-dip propagation of fluids (liquids and/or gas), distribution of shallow gas in marine sediments, and seepage at the seafloor.",

		"abstract": "Bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) on marine seismic data are commonly used to identify the presence of natural gas hydrate in marine sediments, although the exact relationship between gas hydrate and BSRs is undefined. To clarify this relationship we compile a data set of probable gas hydrate occurrence as appraised from well logs of 788 industry wells in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We combine the well log data set with a data set of BSR distribution in the same area identified from 3-D seismic data. We find that a BSR increases the chances of finding gas hydrate by 2.6 times as opposed to drilling outside a BSR and that the wells within a BSR also contain thicker and higher resistivity hydrate accumulations. Even so, over half of the wells drilled through BSRs have no detectable gas hydrate accumulations and gas hydrate occurrences and BSRs do not coincide in most cases.",

		"abstract": "<p>This study represents a marine baseline study for the Longyearbyen CO2 Lab, in which CO2 may be injected in the Upper Triassic&ndash;Middle Jurassic Kapp Toscana Group, which comprises several permeable beds. The target saline aquifer dips 1&ndash;3&deg; southwest and thus crops out 14&ndash;16 km northeast from the proposed injection site in both offshore and onshore settings. Since the aquifer is exposed at the surface, a carefully documented pre-injection baseline study is required prior to any injection. The seafloor and its subsurface conditions are analysed and interpreted, where the targeted aquifer and organic-rich top-seal shales sub-crop. High-resolution multibeam bathymetric and backscatter imaging, sub-bottom acoustic profiles, sidescan sonar data and multichannel 2D seismic data were used to analyse seepage-related features on the seafloor and their link to subsurface tectonic structures. In total, 398 pockmarks have been identified on the seafloor, suggesting significant past and/or present natural fluid seepage. Beneath the pockmarks, acoustic features such as enhanced reflections, acoustic turbid zones and acoustic blankings interpreted on subbottom acoustic profiles suggest possible gas accumulation and migration linked to various fault systems reaching the seafloor. This paper discusses fluid migration in a fold-and-thrust belt setting, broadened by secondary sealing mechanisms in Arctic conditions. We conclude by illustrating the various types of reported fluid seepage, particularly along permeable fault planes and at the rims of igneous intrusions.</p>",

		"abstract": "This study integrates high-resolution surface and sub-surface geophysical data to investigate possible fluid (gas and/or liquids) migration pathways to the seafloor in Grønfjorden, west Spitsbergen. Grønfjorden is an N-S aligned tributary fjord, located in the western part of the Isfjorden fjord system. Pockmarks were identified on the bathymetric data in the southern and northern parts of the fjord. Three types of shallow seep-related acoustic features have been identified in the marine sediments: i) enhanced reflections, ii) acoustic turbid zones, and iii) acoustic blankings. They occur beneath some of the pockmarks and circular patches of high-backscatter on the seafloor in the central part of the fjord, which are potential seep-related seafloor features. 6–8km long NNW-SSE striking ridges have been identified in the southern part of the study area. Thrust faults were interpreted on 2D multichannel seismic data truncating the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous successions of western Isfjorden, located north of Grønfjorden. A possible link has been found between these fault systems and the seafloor ridges which strike in a similar direction. Further, a normal fault has been identified within the shallow marine sediments which drapes the bedrock of the fjord. The fractured bedrock of the fjord and faults associated with the West Spitsbergen fold-and-thrust belt could possibly represent major conduits for fluid migration from deeper stratigraphy to shallow marine sediments and the seafloor.",

		"abstract": "The Longyearbyen CO2 Lab of Svalbard, Norway was established to estimate the potential for geological carbon sequestration at Spitsbergen. Several monitoring wells were drilled in and around the planned CO2 injection site. These revealed a Triassic to Cretaceous stratigraphy consisting of (from top to bottom) a zone of permafrost, the aquifer, the caprock shale, and the upper, middle and lower reservoir. This paper uses two tools to investigate fluid communication within and between these entities: 87Sr/86Sr of formation waters extracted from cores using the residual salt analysis (RSA) method, and the δ13C of gases, principally methane and CO2, degassed from core samples. The Sr RSA data reveal that the upper reservoir rocks have very constant formation water 87Sr/86Sr (0.7130) in wells several kilometres apart, suggesting good lateral communication on a geological timescale. However, there is a distinct barrier to vertical communication within the middle reservoir, indicated by a step change in 87Sr/86Sr (0.7130–0.7112), corresponding to thin but presumably laterally extensive (>1.5km) lagoonal mudrocks. The aquifer, which shows a gradient in 87Sr/86Sr, is also interpreted to have some degree of vertical internal communication on a geological time scale. The caprock shale shows large-scale (over 350m) smooth vertical gradient in 87Sr/86Sr (0.7200-0.7130). This is indicative of an ongoing mixing process between high- 87Sr/86Sr waters within the caprock and lower- 87Sr/86Sr waters in the underlying reservoir. Diffusion and flow modelling of the Sr data suggest that at some time in the past, shale fluid transport properties were enhanced by the formation of temporary pressure escape features (fractures or chimneys) during deep burial and uplift, or cycles of glaciation. Nevertheless, the smooth compositional gradient in the caprock indicates that fluid mixing has subsequently taken place slowly, dominated by diffusion. This interpretation is supported by the gas isotope data, where systematic variations in gas δ13C (-50‰ to −32‰) values also indicate slow and incomplete diffusional fluid mixing. These are positive indicators for caprock effectiveness during a CO2 injection project.",

		"abstract": "Thermogenic dry gas flowed from Jurassic sections in the DH5R research well drilled onshore in Adventdalen, central Spitsbergen, Arctic Norway. The DH5R gas originates from the organic-rich units of the mudstone-dominated Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Agardhfjellet Formation, which is the onshore equivalent to the Fuglen Formation and the prolific oil and gas generating Hekkingen Formation in the southern Barents Shelf. Low-permeable, low-porosity sandstones from the Upper Triassic De Geerdalen Formation of the neighbouring DH4 well were oil-stained and gas was also collected from this interval. Gas from the two stratigraphic intervals have different compositions; the gas from the Agardhfjellet Formation is drier and isotopically heavier than the gas from the Upper Triassic succession. Both gases originated from source rocks of maturity near the end of the oil window (1.1 < Ro < 1.4% Ro). Maceral analyses of the Agardhfjellet Formation indicate that the more silty parts contain a high percentage of vitrinite-rich type III kerogen, whereas the clay-dominated parts are rich in liptinitic type II kerogen. The Agardhfjellet Formation has therefore the potential to generate both oil and gas. Several simulations based on pressure data and flow rates from the DH5R well were run to evaluate if the gas accumulation in the Agardhfjellet Formation is producible, i.e., can it be commercial shale gas. The models demonstrate how changes in the drainage area size and form, well types (vertical versus horizontal), number and length of induced fractures and thickness of the Agardhfjellet Formation affect gas production rates and producible volumes. Despite uncertainties in the input data, simulations indicate that the shale gas accumulation characterised in Adventdalen is producible. This gas can have major environmental benefits as an alternative for local power generation compared to coal.",

This part of the hydrate stability zone is particularly relevant for studies of the dynamics of hydrate accumulations, such as processes related to slope stability or hydrate dissociation leading to methane release into the overlying ocean. For regions with very low geothermal gradients, we have produced a series of thermobaric models of the shallow hydrate stability zone that contain an unexpected geometrical distribution of hydrated sediments. In these models, the shallowest part of the stability field thickens and bulges landward. Such a feature is more likely to happen in regions where low geothermal gradients are further lowered by high sedimentation rates. Also, the effect is greater beneath colder oceans. Although a hydrate stability zone bulge would be difficult to image with conventional seismic methods, there are numerous locations around the world where such a system could develop.",

		"abstract": "Methane is the most widespread volatile hydrocarbon and one of the most potent greenhouse gases. Marine sediments form the largest methane reservoir, from where large quantities of methane from gas-saturated sediments are released into the sea water and into the shallow shelf seas, through the water column almost unaltered into the atmosphere. Craters on the sea floor known as pockmarks are often related to seepage of methane-rich fluids originating either from shallow (microbial) or deep (thermogenic) sources. This paper presents the geochemical characteristics of migrating hydrocarbon gas from selected pockmarks and surrounding seabed in Isfjorden and Mohnbukta in western and eastern Spitsbergen, respectively. Collected gas samples, including wet gas fraction, were analyzed for methane concentration and methane carbon stable isotope ratio. Mixtures of microbial and thermogenic methane, together with higher homologies were found in the pockmarks as well as in the adjacent undisturbed seafloor, suggesting that the seepage activity in both areas is currently on the same level. Although the methane concentration profiles and methane stable carbon isotope ratios in Isfjorden and Mohnbukta show signs of biological oxidation and elevated concentrations of ethane/propane indicate input from deeper thermogenic sources. The gas composition and methane carbon stable isotope ratio from Isfjorden and Mohnbukta areas show similar trends, most likely due to originating in the same Mesozoic organic-rich marine mudstone.",

		"abstract": "As global warming occurs, the dissociation of bound methane on Arctic shelves due to ocean current temperature changes may become a major contributor to the global methane budget, and thus contribute to strong positive climate feedback mechanisms. However, little is known about the magnitude and fate of methane emissions from shallow submarine sediments to the atmosphere in the peculiar area. In this paper, we present one of the first direct evidences for seepage on the northwestern Barents Sea shelf. By studying the molecular and isotopic signatures of low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons in seawater, near-surface sediment pore space and the sediment matrix at 26 locations, we provide a detailed view on the partitioning of gaseous hydrocarbons in the sediment-water interface off Spitsbergen. In the free gas phase, low concentration of methane (∼28 ng/g wet Sediment) paired with constantly high isotopic values (∼−65‰) is consistent with high impact of methane oxidation on the isotopic composition. In contrast, high concentrations of adsorbed CH4 (up to 5292 ng/g wet <63 μm) and C2+ (ethane through pentane) (up to 1724 ng/g wet <63 μm) in the sediment matrix suggest that the adsorbed gas is reasonably well protected against microbial degradation. Moreover, the isotopic and molecular signatures of adsorbed CH4 (−38–−60‰; ∼100–∼5300 ng/g wet <63 μm) and C2H6 (−20–−36‰; ∼30–∼1700 ng/g wet <63 μm) indicate an integrated, but strongly varying signal of historic thermally derived hydrocarbon plumes plus in situ adsorbed gas of biological origin. This suggests a minimal exchange and unlike histories of free and adsorbed gas. The majority of gaseous hydrocarbons in the adsorbed pool may be the result of past seepages. Past upward flow of thermogenic gas and impregnation with mature hydrocarbons was particularly strong along tectonic lineaments. Active petroleum source rocks along the continental margin and migration of gaseous hydrocarbons at re-activated fault systems might explain the anomalies along these conduits.",

		"abstract": "The processes associated with the release of CH4 and CO2 from sub-permafrost groundwaters are considered through a year-long monitoring investigation at a terrestrial seepage site in West Spitsbergen. The site is an open system pingo thought to be associated with the uplift of a former sea-floor pockmark in response to marked isostatic recovery of the coastline following local ice sheet loss over the last 10000 years. We find that locally significant emissions of CH4 and (less so) CO2 to the atmosphere result from a seepage < 1 L s-1 that occurs all year. Hydrological and meteorological conditions strongly regulate the emissions, resulting in periodic outbursts of gas-rich fluids following ice fracture events in winter, and significant dilution of the fluids in early summer by meltwater. Evasion of both gases from a pond that forms during the 100 day summer (45.6 + 10.0 gCH4-C m-2 and 768 + 211 gCO2-C m-2) constitute between roughly 20 and 40% of the total annual emissions (223 gCH4-C m-2 a-1 and 2040 gCO2-C m-2 a-1). Seasonal maximum dissolved CH4 concentrations (up to 14.5 mg L-1 CH4) are observed in the fluids that accumulate beneath the winter ice layer. However, seasonal maximum dissolved CO2 levels (up to 233 mg L-1) occur during late summer. Differences between the δ13C-CH4 composition of the winter samples (average 58.2 +/- 8.01 ‰ (s.d.)) and the late summer samples (average 66.9 +/- 5.75 ‰ (s.d.)) suggest minor oxidation during temporary storage beneath the winter ice lid, although a seasonal change in the methane source could also be responsible. However, this isotopic composition is strongly indicative of predominantly biogenic methane production in the marine sediments that lie beneath the thin coastal permafrost layer. Small hotpots of methane emission from sub-permafrost groundwater seepages therefore deserve careful monitoring for an understanding of seasonal methane emissions from permafrost landscapes.",

		"abstract": "The climate in the Arctic is changing faster than in midlatitudes. This is shown by increased temperatures, loss of summer sea ice, earlier snow melt, impacts on ecosystems, and increased economic access. Arctic sea ice volume has decreased by 75% since the 1980s. Long-lasting global anthropogenic forcing from carbon dioxide has increased over the previous decades and is anticipated to increase over the next decades. Temperature increases in response to greenhouse gases are amplified in the Arctic through feedback processes associated with shifts in albedo, ocean and land heat storage, and near-surface longwave radiation fluxes. Thus, for the next few decades out to 2040, continuing environmental changes in the Arctic are very likely, and the appropriate response is to plan for adaptation to these changes. For example, it is very likely that the Arctic Ocean will become seasonally nearly sea ice free before 2050 and possibly within a decade or two, which in turn will further increase Arctic temperatures, economic access, and ecological shifts. Mitigation becomes an important option to reduce potential Arctic impacts in the second half of the 21st century. Using the most recent set of climate model projections (CMIP5), multimodel mean temperature projections show an Arctic-wide end of century increase of +13°C in late fall and +5°C in late spring for a business-as-usual emission scenario (RCP8.5) in contrast to +7°C in late fall and +3°C in late spring if civilization follows a mitigation scenario (RCP4.5). Such temperature increases demonstrate the heightened sensitivity of the Arctic to greenhouse gas forcing.",

		"abstract": "The Barents Sea is a major part of the Arctic where the Gulf Stream mixes with the cold Arctic waters. Late Cenozoic uplift and glacial erosion have resulted in hydrocarbon leakage from reservoirs, evolution of fluid flow systems, shallow gas accumulations, and hydrate formation throughout the Barents Sea. Here we integrate seismic data observations of gas hydrate accumulations along with gas hydrate stability modeling to analyze the impact of warming ocean waters in the recent past and future (1960–2060). Seismic observations of bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) indicate significant thermogenic gas input into the hydrate stability zone throughout the SW Barents Sea. The distribution of BSR is controlled primarily by fluid flow focusing features, such as gas chimneys and faults. Warming ocean bottom temperatures over the recent past and in future (1960–2060) can result in hydrate dissociation over an area covering 0.03–38% of the SW Barents Sea.",

		"abstract": "The potential impact of future climate change on methane release from oceanic gas hydrates is the subject of much debate. We analyzed World Ocean Database quality controlled data on the Norwegian-Svalbard continental margin from the past 60 years to evaluate the potential effect of ocean temperature variations on continental margin gas hydrate reservoirs. Bottom water temperatures in the Norwegian-Svalbard margin were subject to significant cooling until 1980 (by ∼2°C offshore NW-Svalbard and in the Barents Sea) followed by a general bottom water temperature increase until 2010 (∼0.3°C in deep-water areas offshore NW-Svalbard and mid-Norwegian margin and ∼2°C in the shallow areas of the Barents Sea and Prins Karls Forland). Bottom water warming in the shallow outer shelf areas triggered the Gas Hydrate Stability Zone (GHSZ) retreat toward upper continental slope areas, potentially increasing methane release due to gas hydrate dissociation. GHSZ responses to temperature changes on human time scales occur exclusively in shallow water and only if near-surface gas hydrates exist. The responses are associated with a short time lag of less than 1 year. Temperatures in the bottom water column seem to be partly regulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with positive NAO associated with warm phases. However, cooling events in the surface water offshore NW-Svalbard might be associated with El Niño events of 1976–1977, 1986–1987 and 1997–1998 in the Pacific. Such ocean cooling, if long enough, may delay ocean temperature driven gas hydrate dissociation and potential releases of methane to the ocean.",

		"abstract": "The Vestnesa Ridge comprises a >100 km long sediment drift located between the western continental slope of Svalbard and the Arctic mid-ocean ridges. It hosts a deep water (>1000 m) gas hydrate and associated seafloor seepage system. Near-seafloor headspace gas compositions and its methane carbon isotopic signature along the ridge indicate a predominance of thermogenic gas sources feeding the system. Prediction of the base of the gas hydrate stability zone for theoretical pressure and temperature conditions and measured gas compositions results in an unusual underestimation of the observed bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) depth. The BSR is up to 60 m deeper than predicted for pure methane and measured gas compositions with >99% methane. Models for measured gas compositions with >4% higher-order hydrocarbons result in a better BSR approximation. However, the BSR remains >20 m deeper than predicted in a region without active seepage. A BSR deeper than predicted is primarily explained by unaccounted spatial variations in the geothermal gradient and by larger amounts of thermogenic gas at the base of the gas hydrate stability zone. Hydrates containing higher-order hydrocarbons form at greater depths and higher temperatures and contribute with larger amounts of carbons than pure methane hydrates. In thermogenic provinces, this may imply a significant upward revision (up to 50% in the case of Vestnesa Ridge) of the amount of carbon in gas hydrates.",

Warming of the northward-flowing West Spitsbergen current by 1°C over the last thirty years is likely to have increased the release of methane from the seabed by reducing the extent of the GHSZ, causing the liberation of methane from decomposing hydrate. If this process becomes widespread along Arctic continental margins, tens of Teragrams of methane per year could be released into the ocean.",

Firstly, the Palaeozoic Caledonain Orogeny caused uplift to the west, followed by eastward sediment distribution across the shelf, towards carbonate platforms to the east. Secondly the Late Palaeozoic–Mesozoic Uralide Orogeny induced uplift to the east, causing widespread clastic deposition and reversal of the sediment distribution pattern. Thirdly, major Late Mesozoic–Cenozoic rifting and crustal breakup in the western Barents Sea led to the current basin configuration. Reservoir rocks comprise Late Palaeozoic carbonates and spiculites, Mesozoic terrestrial and marine sandstones and Palaeogene deep-water sandstones. Hydrocarbon source rocks range in age from Silurian to Early Cretaceous, and are grouped into three petroleum systems derived from Late Palaeozoic, Triassic and Late Jurassic source rocks. Multiple tectonic episodes caused formation of a variety of trap types, of which extensional fault blocks and gently folded domes have been the most prospective. Volumetric considerations of generated petroleum indicate that charging is not a limiting factor, except in the western margin.",

		"abstract": "The presence of migrated petroleum in outcropping rocks on Spitsbergen (Svalbard archipelago) has been known for several decades but the petroleum has not been evaluated by modern geochemical methods. This paper presents detailed organic geochemical observations on bitumen in outcrop samples from central and eastern Spitsbergen. The samples comprise sandstones from the Lower Cretaceous Carolinefjellet Formation, the Upper Triassic – Middle Jurassic Wilhelmøya Subgroup and the Upper Triassic De Geerdalen Formation; a limestone from the De Geerdalen Formation; and carbonates from the Middle Jurassic – Lower Cretaceous Agardhfjellet Formation. In addition a palaeo-seepage oil was sampled from a vug in the Middle Triassic Botneheia Formation. This data is integrated with the results of analyses of C1–C4 hydrocarbon fluid inclusions trapped in quartz and calcite cements in these samples. Organic geochemical data suggest that the petroleum present in the samples analysed can be divided into two compositional groups (Group I and Group II). Group I petroleums have distinctive biomarker characteristics including Pr/Ph ratios of about 1.3–1.5, high tricyclic terpanes relative to pentacyclic terpanes, and relatively high methyl-dibenzothiophenes compared to methyl-phenanthrenes. By contrast Group II petroleums have low tricyclic terpanes relative to pentacyclic terpanes and low methyl-dibenzothiophenes compared to methyl-phenanthrenes, and most Pr/Ph ratios range from 1.90 to 2.57. The petroleum in both groups was derived from marine shale source rocks deposited in proximal to open marine settings. Group I petroleums, present in the sandstones of the Wilhelmøya Subgroup and the De Geerdalen Formation and as a palaeo-seepage oil in the vug in the Botneheia Formation, are likely to have been sourced from the Middle Triassic Botneheia Formation. Group II petroleums, found in the sandstone of the Carolinefjellet Formation, the limestone from the De Geerdalen Formation and in carbonates of the Agardhfjellet Formation, are inferred to have been generated from the Jurassic-Cretaceous Agardhfjellet Formation. The analysis of biomarker and aromatic hydrocarbons in the petroleums indicate three relative maturation levels, equivalent to expulsion at vitrinite reflectances of about 0.7–0.8%Rc, 0.8–0.9%Rc and 1.0–1.6%Rc. On average, Triassic host rocks contain petroleum of higher maturity compared to the Jurassic and Cretaceous host rocks. The fluid inclusion data suggest that gaseous hydrocarbons from the sandstones of the Wilhelmøya Subgroup are thermogenic, and are of similar maturity to the petroleum in extracts from these sandstones, suggesting that the gas was generated together with oil in the oil window. By contrast the inclusion gases from carbonate rocks analysed have a mixed (thermogenic / biogenic) origin. The outcropping rocks in which these oils occur are analogous to offshore reservoirs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The study may therefore improve our understanding of the subsurface offshore petroleum systems in the Barents Sea and possibly also in other circum-Arctic basins.",

The identified landforms include two types of transverse ridges interpreted as terminal and annual moraines, flat areas that are depressions filled with glaciomarine sediments, iceberg-generated pits and ploughmarks, pockmarks and fields of megaripples. Most of the identified landforms are genetically related to the retreat of Hansbreen since the termination of the Little Ice Age at the beginning of the twentieth century. Although Hansbreen has been speculated to be a surge-type glacier, no evidence of surging was identified in the submarine landform assemblage, which is in accordance with the absence of historically documented surges for that period.",

		"abstract": "Swath bathymetry and chirp data have been used to investigate the submarine landform assemblages in inner Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, to reconstruct glacial dynamics during the Late Holocene. Multiple sets of landforms include two types of glacial lineations (groove-ridge features and small, drumlinoid ridges), terminal moraines and associated debris lobes, as well as small push moraines, and indicate repeated surge activity during the last 150 years for four of the five tidewater glaciers terminating in inner Kongsfjorden. Aside from confirming previously documented surges of Kronebreen in 1869, of Kongsvegen, in 1948, and of Blomstrandbreen in 1960, the local bathymetry also indicates a surge of Kongsbreen in 1897, a glacier that has so far been regarded as a non-surge type glacier. \nA conceptual model was developed to summarize the surge-induced landform assemblages in Kongsfjorden, and to compare them with other models from terrestrial and marine settings. Striking similarities exist between the Kongsfjorden model and landform assemblages documented for other Spitsbergen fjords. However, eskers and crevasse-fill ridges, the latter thought to be the only landform certainly indicative of glacier surges, lack in Kongsfjorden. Furthermore, the small, drumlinoid ridges inferred to be suggestive of the past ice flow direction in the study area seem to have more in common with glacial lineations generated by surging glaciers on land. \nThe acoustic data was supplemented with two sediment cores from Kongsfjorden’s innermost basin. The reworked glacimarine deposits at the base of the more proximal core reflect proximal conditions, as they are part of a debris lobe that formed on the distal flank of the terminal moraine deposited during the 1948 surge of Kongsvegen. The stratified muds from the second core contain varying amounts of clasts and also occur on top of the debris lobe. They reveal a relatively distal glacimarine environment mainly influenced by suspension settling from turbid meltwater emanating from Kronebreen or Kongsvegen. Geochemical fluctuations indicate temporal variations in the sediment supply from the two glaciers after 1948.  \nThe few landforms in the outer parts of the study area suggest glacial activity unrelated to the glacier surges. Together with the landforms previously documented from outer Kongsfjorden and its adjacent trough (Kongsfjordrenna), the mega-scale glacial lineations in the outer part of the study area indicate part of a landform assemblage deposited from a fast-flowing ice stream during the Last Glacial Maximum.",

		"abstract": "Understanding the role of fjords in modulating the long-term interaction between ice sheets and glaciers with the surrounding ocean requires the investigation of glacigenic landform and sediment archives. In Svalbard, there is a wealth of data from fjords in west Spitsbergen that constrains the glacial history of this sector of the Svalbard-Barents Sea Ice Sheet (SBIS) since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and the nature and timing of subsequent ice retreat. In contrast, however, very little is known about the glacial history of fjords in east Spitsbergen. This paper combines multibeam swath-bathymetry, sub-bottom profiles, lithological data and radiocarbon dates from Lomfjorden, Svalbard, to provide the first insights into the dynamics of tidewater glaciers and associated glacimarine sedimentary processes in a northeast Spitsbergen fjord. At the LGM, a fast-flowing ice stream drained the SBIS through Lomfjorden, serving as a tributary to a south-north flowing ice stream in Hinlopenstretet. Ice advance is recorded by streamlined bedrock, glacial lineations and drumlins. A radiocarbon date of ∼9.7ka BP from the outer fjord provides a minimum date for retreat of this ice stream, and suggests that Lomfjorden was ice-free earlier than fjords in west Spitsbergen. Ice retreat occurred in a slow and step-wise manner, indicated by the presence of recessional moraines and De Geer moraines. By 4.5ka BP the local tidewater glaciers had probably retreated inland of their present positions. The limited extent of glacigenic landform assemblages in front of these glaciers implies that any Holocene re-advances were probably restricted. The principal sedimentary processes during deglaciation were suspension settling from meltwater, causing deposition of weakly stratified, bioturbated mud in ice-distal settings at rates of 0.02–0.08cm a−1, and gravitational mass flows forming sandy turbidites in ice-proximal areas. Iceberg ploughmarks and ice-rafted debris provide evidence for the presence of large icebergs during deglaciation. Our data suggest an early and extensive deglaciation in east Spitsbergen fjords and show that previous reconstructions of the extent of the SBIS need to be revised as new data emerges from east Spitsbergen. The data confirm that tidewater glaciers from different regions of Spitsbergen behaved differently since the LGM, and that variations in landform-sediment assemblages occur even within geographically adjacent fjords.",

The technique is commonly used for the characterisation of outcrops, fracture mapping, and increasingly so for the quantification of deformation during geotechnical stress tests. We here apply SfM photogrammetry using off-the-shelf components and software, to generate 25 digital drill core models of drill cores. The selected samples originate from the Longyearbyen CO2 Lab project&rsquo;s borehole DH4, covering the lowermost cap rock and uppermost reservoir sequences proposed for CO2 sequestration onshore Svalbard. We have come up with a procedure that enables the determination of bulk volumes and densities with precisions and accuracies similar to those of such conventional methods as the immersion in fluid method. We use 3D printed replicas to qualitatively assure the volumes, and show that, with a mean deviation (based on eight samples) of 0.059% compared to proven geotechnical methods, the photogrammetric output is found to be equivalent. We furthermore splice together broken and fragmented core pieces to reconstruct larger core intervals. We unwrap these to generate and characterise 2D orthographic projections of the core edge using analytical workflows developed for the structure-sedimentological characterisation of virtual outcrop models. Drill core orthoprojections can be treated as directly correlatable to optical borehole-wall imagery data, enabling a direct and cost-effective elucidation of in situ drill core orientation and depth, as long as any form of borehole imagery is available. Digital drill core models are thus complementary to existing physical and photographic sample archives, and we foresee that the presented workflow can be adopted for the digitisation and digital storage of other types of geological samples, including degradable and dangerous ice and sediment cores and samples.",

		"abstract": "Natural gas hydrates occur worldwide in polar regions, normally associated with onshore and offshore permafrost, and in sediment of outer continental and insular margins. The total amount of methane in gas hydrates likely exceeds 1019 g of methane carbon. Three aspects of gas hydrates are important: their fossil fuel resource potential, their role as a submarine geohazard, and their effects on global climate change. Because gas hydrates represent a large amount of methane within 2000 m of the Earth's surface, they are considered to be an unconventional, unproven source of fossil fuel. Because gas hydrates are metastable, changes of pressure and temperature affect their stability. Destabilized gas hydrates beneath the seafloor lead to geologic hazards such as submarine slumps and slides, examples of which are found worldwide. Destabilized gas hydrates may also affect climate through the release of methane, a “greenhouse” gas, which may enhance global warming and be a factor in global climate change.",

In Munindalen near Pyramiden (Dickson Land, Svalbard), low mature middle to upper Devonian strata (Mimerdalen Subgroup) crop out, which bear well recognizable terrestrial coal seams. Here, we report new geochemical and petrographical data of this ancient coal and compare them with younger coals of Svalbard from the Carboniferous, a period when land-dwelling plants started to rule the terrestrial realm. Similar to other Devonian cannel coals (highly bituminous terrestrial coals), the Munindalen coals are rich in spores and were most likely formed by early lycopsid trees in a near-equatorial setting. Geochemical data are in line with a predominantly liptinite-related origin of the coaly matter and the coals demonstrate a high hydrocarbon (oil) generation potential [hydrogen index: 570 mg hydrocarbons (HC)/g total organic carbon (TOC)]. Biomarkers support a terrestrial plant origin of the coals and demonstrate the geochemical simplicity of these very early terrestrial plants (e.g., by the lack of specific diterpanes known from modern plants and the occurrence of sterane-related simple pregnanes).",

Samples from two drill cores (DH2 and DH5R) were analysed for δ13Corg, total organic carbon (TOC) and Rock Eval. Rock Eval, litho- and biostratigraphy demonstrate a similar development in the two cores, allowing construction of a composite δ13Corg curve covering the Bathonian to lowermost Cretaceous. There are only weak correlations between Rock Eval parameters and δ13Corg, suggesting the isotopic signal is not mainly controlled by type of kerogen/maturation but rather reflects regional or global environmental changes. The carbon–isotope curves from the cores can be correlated with previously published curves from outcrops of the Slottsmøya Member and with more distant localities in the Barents Sea, Siberia, Great Britain and the Atlantic. Features in common with other published curves include a Callovian–Oxfordian positive excursion, a Kimmeridgian–Middle Volgian negative trend and a Middle Volgian negative excursion. These correlations allow refinement chronostratigraphy of the Jurassic of Svalbard.",

		"abstract": "Modern oil and gas exploration on Svalbard has not yet resulted in any commercial discoveries. Is this symptomatic of the area, or may new play concepts and improved exploration techniques change this picture? This is a key question regarding a remote exploration province where, as we judge it, the hydrocarbon potential has barely been tested successfully, despite the recent completion of a 14th wildcat. Post-Devonian sediments cover most of central Spitsbergen south of Isfjorden and east of the West Spitsbergen Orogenic Belt. The basic preconditions for a hydrocarbon discovery seem to be met in general: mature source, reservoir and cap rocks are known to exist and several closed structures have been mapped. Yet, based on tectonic style, basin filling and timing, the prospectivity of different exploration sub-provinces can be clearly discriminated between. Sub-province 1 -– West Spitsbergen Orogenic Belt: The eastern, thin-skinned part of the West Spitsbergen Orogenic Belt (Tertiary) has a limited hydrocarbon potential. Ramp anticlinal structuring within late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic carbonates and clastics produced closures, but strong cementation and tectonic fracturing have partly destroyed reservoir quality and cap rock properties. Sub-province 2 -– Central Spitsbergen Basin, west flank: The west flank and axial part of the Central Spitsbergen Basin foredeep also has a limited potential. Blind anticlinal closures in the late Mesozoic-Tertiary overlie deeper ramp anticlines or thrust duplexes, but with overall poor reservoir quality and cap rock properties. High thermal maturation indicates a gas prone area. Sub-province 3 -– Central Spitsbergen Basin east flank: Improved reservoir quality and maturation profile (north) eastwards are negated by a general lack of larger scale structuring along the east flank of the Central Spitsbergen Basin. Sub-province 4 -– Billefjorden Fault Zone, eastwards: Carboniferous extensional tectonics and fault block rotation produced large closures, and good quality source, reservoir and cap rocks are present in Carboniferous-Permian outcrops. However, thermal maturity varies from oil to gas maturation and reservoir quality is reduced with increasing subsurface depths. Ramp anticlines (Tertiary) above a Mesozoic decollement produce a second play. Oil prone source rocks are present, but structural closures are generally small and reservoir and cap rock properties become a problem. Further eastwards, less structuring reduces the general trap potential. One exception is along the Lomfjorden Fault Zone, where ramp anticlines are also present. Reservoir quality and source rock maturation seem favourable, but present shallow burial reduces the seal potential.",

		"abstract": "Swath bathymetry and chirp data have been used to investigate the submarine landform assemblages in inner Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, to reconstruct glacial dynamics during the Late Holocene. Multiple sets of landforms include two types of glacial lineations (groove-ridge features and small, drumlinoid ridges), terminal moraines and associated debris lobes, as well as small push moraines, and indicate repeated surge activity during the last 150 years for four of the five tidewater glaciers terminating in inner Kongsfjorden. Aside from confirming previously documented surges of Kronebreen in 1869, of Kongsvegen, in 1948, and of Blomstrandbreen in 1960, the local bathymetry also indicates a surge of Kongsbreen in 1897, a glacier that has so far been regarded as a non-surge type glacier. \nA conceptual model was developed to summarize the surge-induced landform assemblages in Kongsfjorden, and to compare them with other models from terrestrial and marine settings. Striking similarities exist between the Kongsfjorden model and landform assemblages documented for other Spitsbergen fjords. However, eskers and crevasse-fill ridges, the latter thought to be the only landform certainly indicative of glacier surges, lack in Kongsfjorden. Furthermore, the small, drumlinoid ridges inferred to be suggestive of the past ice flow direction in the study area seem to have more in common with glacial lineations generated by surging glaciers on land. \nThe acoustic data was supplemented with two sediment cores from Kongsfjorden’s innermost basin. The reworked glacimarine deposits at the base of the more proximal core reflect proximal conditions, as they are part of a debris lobe that formed on the distal flank of the terminal moraine deposited during the 1948 surge of Kongsvegen. The stratified muds from the second core contain varying amounts of clasts and also occur on top of the debris lobe. They reveal a relatively distal glacimarine environment mainly influenced by suspension settling from turbid meltwater emanating from Kronebreen or Kongsvegen. Geochemical fluctuations indicate temporal variations in the sediment supply from the two glaciers after 1948.  \nThe few landforms in the outer parts of the study area suggest glacial activity unrelated to the glacier surges. Together with the landforms previously documented from outer Kongsfjorden and its adjacent trough (Kongsfjordrenna), the mega-scale glacial lineations in the outer part of the study area indicate part of a landform assemblage deposited from a fast-flowing ice stream during the Last Glacial Maximum.",

		"abstract": "Understanding the role of fjords in modulating the long-term interaction between ice sheets and glaciers with the surrounding ocean requires the investigation of glacigenic landform and sediment archives. In Svalbard, there is a wealth of data from fjords in west Spitsbergen that constrains the glacial history of this sector of the Svalbard-Barents Sea Ice Sheet (SBIS) since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and the nature and timing of subsequent ice retreat. In contrast, however, very little is known about the glacial history of fjords in east Spitsbergen. This paper combines multibeam swath-bathymetry, sub-bottom profiles, lithological data and radiocarbon dates from Lomfjorden, Svalbard, to provide the first insights into the dynamics of tidewater glaciers and associated glacimarine sedimentary processes in a northeast Spitsbergen fjord. At the LGM, a fast-flowing ice stream drained the SBIS through Lomfjorden, serving as a tributary to a south-north flowing ice stream in Hinlopenstretet. Ice advance is recorded by streamlined bedrock, glacial lineations and drumlins. A radiocarbon date of ∼9.7ka BP from the outer fjord provides a minimum date for retreat of this ice stream, and suggests that Lomfjorden was ice-free earlier than fjords in west Spitsbergen. Ice retreat occurred in a slow and step-wise manner, indicated by the presence of recessional moraines and De Geer moraines. By 4.5ka BP the local tidewater glaciers had probably retreated inland of their present positions. The limited extent of glacigenic landform assemblages in front of these glaciers implies that any Holocene re-advances were probably restricted. The principal sedimentary processes during deglaciation were suspension settling from meltwater, causing deposition of weakly stratified, bioturbated mud in ice-distal settings at rates of 0.02–0.08cm a−1, and gravitational mass flows forming sandy turbidites in ice-proximal areas. Iceberg ploughmarks and ice-rafted debris provide evidence for the presence of large icebergs during deglaciation. Our data suggest an early and extensive deglaciation in east Spitsbergen fjords and show that previous reconstructions of the extent of the SBIS need to be revised as new data emerges from east Spitsbergen. The data confirm that tidewater glaciers from different regions of Spitsbergen behaved differently since the LGM, and that variations in landform-sediment assemblages occur even within geographically adjacent fjords.",

Van Keulenfjorden was covered with a grounded glacier during the last glacial, and it was deglaciated between c. 11.8 and 11.3 cal. ka BP. The retreat of the ice front accelerated from approximately 80 to 190 m/a during the deglaciation. The maximum late Holocene glacier extent occurred after surge-like advances of the glacier Nathorstbreen between 2790 and 2610 cal. yr BP (i.e. during a period with the coldest climatic conditions on Svalbard). This maximum extent was reached approximately 2600 years earlier than inferred for most fjords on Svalbard, suggesting that surge-like glacier advances on Svalbard can occur under variable climatic conditions. The time interval between the advances of Nathorstbreen around 2.7 ka BP was approximately 100–150 years. This is comparable to the last and only historically known quiescent phase of Nathorstbreen of c. 120 years between the late 19th century and the most recent surge from 2003 to 2012.",

		"abstract": "In the years 2000 and 2001 we measured methane concentrations exceeding up to two orders of magnitude the equilibrium with the atmosphere in the water column on the SW-Spitsbergen continental shelf. This methane anomaly extended from its centre on the shelf westwards over the upper slope and eastwards well into the inner basins of the two southernmost Spitsbergen fjords, the Hornsundfjord and the van Mijenfjord. Methane concentrations and stable carbon isotopic ratios varied between 2 and 240nM, and between −53‰ and −20‰ VPDB, respectively. Methane in high concentrations was depleted in 13C whereas in low concentrations δ13CCH4 values were highly variable. On the continental shelf we found that methane discharged from seeps on top of sandy and gravelly banks is isotopically heavier than methane escaping from troughs filled with silty and clayey sediments. These distinct isotopic signatures suggest that methane is gently released from several inter-granular seepages or micro-seepages widely spread over the shelf. A potential migration path for thermogenic or hydrate methane may be the Hornsund Fracture Zone, a south–north running reactivated fault system created by stretching of the continental crust. After discharge into the water column, local water currents fed by Atlantic water, coastal water, and freshwater outflows from the fjords further determine pathways and fate of the methane. We used δ18Owater and 222Rn data to trace origin and advection of the local water masses and water mixing processes. Methane spreads predominantly along pycnoclines and by vertical mixing. During transport methane is influenced simultaneously by oxidation and dilution, as well as loss into the atmosphere. Together these processes cause the spatial variability of the anomaly and heterogeneity in δ13CCH4 in this polar shelf environment.",

		"abstract": "A detailed map of the structure of the west Spitsbergen fold-and-thrust belt in the Isfjorden area, Spitsbergen, is presented. The map was constructed from a dense grid of two-dimensional multichannel reflection seismic and bathymetric data. Joint interpretation of two data sets allowed a comparison of tectonic structures detected along the uppermost parts of the seismic sections and those reflected in the morphology of the seafloor. Three major, predominantly north-west–south-east striking faults were identified. The westernmost fault (T1) is a hinterland-directed (most likely out of sequence) thrust, while the central and easternmost faults (T2 and T3) are foreland-directed (in-sequence thrusts). The thrusts divide Isfjorden into three subareas. Subarea 1 is bounded by thrust faults T1 and T2 and comprises Tertiary rocks surrounded by Jurassic–Cretaceous strata. The structural signature of Subarea 1 is that of a system of hinterland- and foreland-directed thrust faults, resulting in a seafloor relief characterized by parallel ridges and troughs. Subarea 2 is limited by thrust faults T2 and T3 and shows Jurassic–Cretaceous outcrops on the seafloor. Subarea 3 is situated east of the main thrust fault T3 and mainly involves outcrops of Triassic–Jurassic rocks. Together, Subareas 2 and 3 are dominated by foreland-directed, north-west–south-east and NNW–SSE-striking thrusts that are hardly detectable in bathymetric data.",

		"abstract": "This paper describes measurements of ice conditions in the fjord Van Mijenfjorden, Spitsbergen, in the Svalbard Archipelago, between 1998 and 2006. Ice thickness, ice temperatures and ice properties were measured, and simple simulations of oceanic flux were performed. The maximum annual peak ice thickness was measured in 2004: 1.3 m in the inner basin and 1.2 m in the outer basin. The minimum annual peak thickness was 0.72 m in the inner basin and no fast ice in the outer basin, in 2006. The estimated oceanic flux was about 2–5 W m-2 in the outer basin, and was close to zero in the inner basin. Flooding and brine drainage may have caused an overestimation of the oceanic flux. The measurements demonstrate different ice growth mechanisms, and the simplest model (Stefan’s Law with air temperatures and a correction factor) fails to predict the ice growth. Finally, there is reason to believe that the ice conditions were heavier in the 1980s.",

		"abstract": "Twelve glaciers, representing various types, were investigated between 2000 and 2005, in a region adjacent to the northern reaches of Billefjorden, central Spitsbergen (Svalbard). On the basis of measurements taken using reference points, DGPS and GPS systems, analyses of aerial photographs and satellite images, geomorphological indicators and archival data their rates of deglaciation following the \"Little Ice Age\" (LIA) maximum were calculated variously on centennial, decadal and annual time scales. As most Svalbard glaciers have debris-covered snouts, a clean ice margin was measured in the absence of debris-free ice front. The retreat rates for both types of ice fronts were very similar. All studied glaciers have been retreating since the termination of the Little Ice Age at the end of 19th century. The fastest retreat rate was observed in the case of the Nordenskioldbreen tidewater glacier (mean average linear retreat rate 35 m a-1). For land-terminating glaciers the rates were in range of 5 to 15 m a-1. Presumably owing to climate warming, most of the glacier retreat rates have increased several fold in recent decades. The secondary factors influencing the retreat rates have been identified as: water depth at the grounding line in the case of tidewater glaciers, surging history, altitude, shape and aspect of glacier margin, and bedrock relief. The retreat rates are similar to glaciers from other parts of Spitsbergen. Analyses of available data on glacier retreat rates in Svalbard have allowed us to distinguish four major types: very dynamic, surging tidewater glaciers with post-LIA retreat rates of between 100 and 220 ma-1, other tidewater glaciers receding of a rate of 15 to 70 m a-1, land terminating valley polythermal glaciers with an average retreat of 10 to 20 m a-1 and small, usually cold, glaciers with the retreat rates below 10 m a-1.",

The Troll waters are dominated by Na–HCO3 compositions and the Jotun waters by Na–Cl compositions. The pristine thermal water source has a sub-neutral pH and is highly reducing. Taken at face value, common geothermometers suggest temperatures at depth of 130–180°C for the Troll springs (corresponding to a depth of 1.6–2.3 km), with 10–30% thermal water diluted by 70–90% cold water. Such geothermometers may, however, be inappropriate to the cool, high CO2 waters of Bockfjord, and real temperatures at depth and dilution factors are probably considerably lower. The salinity of the thermal water appears to be only partially derived from water–rock interaction; Br\\Cl ratios suggest that seawater or possibly evaporites may be a source of chloride salinity.",

To clarify this relationship we compile a data set of probable gas hydrate occurrence as appraised from well logs of 788 industry wells in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We combine the well log data set with a data set of BSR distribution in the same area identified from 3-D seismic data. We find that a BSR increases the chances of finding gas hydrate by 2.6 times as opposed to drilling outside a BSR and that the wells within a BSR also contain thicker and higher resistivity hydrate accumulations. Even so, over half of the wells drilled through BSRs have no detectable gas hydrate accumulations and gas hydrate occurrences and BSRs do not coincide in most cases.",

Although other gases can naturally form clathrate hydrates (referred to after as ‘hydrate’), we are concerned here only with hydrocarbon gases that form hydrates. The most important of these natural gases is methane. Whereas the first book is a general introduction to the subject of natural gas hydrate, this book focuses on the geology and geochemical controls of gas hydrate development and on gas extraction from naturally occurring hydrocarbon hydrates. This is the first broad treatment of gas hydrate as a natural resource within an economic geological framework. This book is written mainly to stand alone for brevity and to minimize duplication. Information in Max (2000; 2003) should also be consulted for completeness. Hydrate is a type of clathrate (Sloan, 1998) that is formed from a cage structure of water molecules in which gas molecules occupying void sites within the cages stabilize the structure through van der Waals or hydrogen bonding.",

		"abstract": "Isfjorden, a broad Arctic fjord in western Spitsbergen, has shown \nsignificant changes in hydrography and inflow of Atlantic Water (AW) the\nlast decades that only recently have been observed in the Arctic Ocean\nnorth of Svalbard. Variability and trends in this fjord's climate and\ncirculation are therefore analysed from observational and reanalysis\ndata during the time period 1987 to 2017. Over this period, Isfjorden\nhas experienced a shift in summer ocean structure, from having AW\ngenerally in the bottom layer before 2006, to having AW (with increasing\nthickness) higher up in the water column from 2006. This shift, and a\nconcomitant shift to less fast ice in Isfjorden are linked to positive\ntrends in the mean sea surface temperature (SST) and volume weighted\nmean temperature (VT) in winter (SSTw/VTw: 0.6\n± 0.1 / 0.9 ± 0.3 °C 10yr-1) and summer\n(SSTS/VTS: 0.6 ± 0.1°C\n10yr-1). Hence, the local mean air temperature also shows a\npositive trend in winter (1.9 ± 0.4 °C 10yr-1) and\nsummer (0.7 ± 0.1 °C 10yr-1) over the same time\nperiod. Moreover, a positive trend in volume weighted mean salinity in\nwinter (0.21 ± 0.06 10yr-1) and summer (0.06 ±\n0.05 10yr-1) suggests increased advection of AW as a main\nreason for Isfjorden's climate change during the studied time period.\nFurther, local mean air temperature correlates significantly with sea\nice cover, SST, and VT, revealing the impact of the fjord's climate on\nthe local terrestrial climate. Isfjorden has changed from being an\nArctic type fjord dominated by deep (Winter Deep) and intermediate\n(Winter Intermediate) thermal and haline convection with sea ice\nformation, to a more Atlantic type fjord dominated by deep thermal\nconvection of Atlantic type water (Winter Open). The lack of sea ice and\nmore AW intrusion on the shelf outside, result in denser shelf water in\nwinter, leading warmer AW from West Spitsbergen Current on top. This\nstudy of trends and changes in processes governing the inflow to\nIsfjorden, demonstrates that Isfjorden and its ocean climate can be used\nas a thermometer for climate change in the Arctic Ocean.",

		"abstract": "Multiple proxies in the geological record offshore NW Svalbard track shallow subseafloor diagenesis and seafloor methane seepage during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) extent and the disintegration of the Svalbard Barents Sea Ice Sheet (SBIS). Vestnesa Ridge, located at 79°N and in 1200 m water depth, is one of the northernmost known active methane seep sites and is characterised by a subseafloor fluid flow system, numerous seafloor pockmarks and gas flares in the water column. In this study, we develop a Late Pleistocene and Holocene stratigraphic framework, use stable oxygen and carbon isotope signatures (δ18O, δ13C) of benthic and planktic foraminifera, the mineralogical and carbon isotope composition of methane-derived authigenic carbonate (MDAC) and sediment geochemical data of ten sediment cores to assess methane seepage variability on Vestnesa Ridge. The studied cores cover the age range between 31.9 and 10 cal ka BP and record 32 negative δ13C excursions in benthic and planktic foraminifera with amplitudes down to −29 ‰ VPDB. These δ13C excursions are often associated with elevated Ca/Ti and Sr/Ti elemental ratios in sediments and MDAC nodules. The precipitation of MDAC overgrowth on foraminiferal tests explains most of the negative δ13C excursions. In this dataset, the oldest recorded methane emission episodes on Vestnesa Ridge occurred between the LGM (24–23.5 cal ka BP) and Heinrich Event 1 (HE 1; 17.7–16.8 cal ka BP). Geological indicators for past subseafloor methane cycling and seafloor methane seepage, such as negative foraminiferal δ13C excursions, MDAC nodules, and elevated Sr/Ti elemental ratios recorded in post-LGM sediments, possibly represent vertical migration of the sulphate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) and post-date sedimentation by up to 13.4 ka. However, it is important to note that indications of post-LGM seafloor methane seepage at Vestnesa Ridge also correspond to the established methane efflux chronology for the adjacent Barents Sea shelf, implying that glacio-isostatic adjustments and associated re-activation of pre-existing deep-seated faults after disintegration of the SBIS are likely important controlling factors on fluid migration towards the seafloor.",

		"abstract": "Seafloor methane release due to the thermal dissociation of gas hydrates is pervasive across the continental margins of the Arctic Ocean. Furthermore, there is increasing awareness that shallow hydrate-related methane seeps have appeared due to enhanced warming of Arctic Ocean bottom water during the last century. Although it has been argued that a gas hydrate gun could trigger abrupt climate change, the processes and rates of subsurface/atmospheric natural gas exchange remain uncertain. Here we investigate the dynamics between gas hydrate stability and environmental changes from the height of the last glaciation through to the present day. Using geophysical observations from offshore Svalbard to constrain a coupled ice sheet/gas hydrate model, we identify distinct phases of subglacial methane sequestration and subsequent release on ice sheet retreat that led to the formation of a suite of seafloor domes. Reconstructing the evolution of this dome field, we find that incursions of warm Atlantic bottom water forced rapid gas hydrate dissociation and enhanced methane emissions during the penultimate Heinrich event, the Bølling and Allerød interstadials, and the Holocene optimum. Our results highlight the complex interplay between the cryosphere, geosphere, and atmosphere over the last 30,000 y that led to extensive changes in subseafloor carbon storage that forced distinct episodes of methane release due to natural climate variability well before recent anthropogenic warming.",

Group III pingos are located in nearshore or low-lying environments of active geologic uplift, where groundwater flow is in response to relict conditions. In this paper group III pingos in the Adventdalen delta area are examined. Group III pingos characteristically have a complex shape and occur in groups. Growth occurs rapidly after initial emergence from marine conditions and the establishment of a minimum permafrost thickness. Water is supplied through discontinuities in the aggrading permafrost.

		"abstract": "In the southern part of the Norwegian Barents Sea extensive hydrocarbon exploration and drilling has led to several oil and gas discoveries, yet little is known on the petroleum systems and potential hydrocarbon reservoirs in the northern Norwegian Barents Sea. If hydrocarbons generated by thermogenic processes deep in the subsurface migrate to the surface, traces of these hydrocarbons can remain in the near-surface sediments and provide indirect information on potential petroleum systems. Near-surface hydrocarbon prospecting is a method frequently used in hydrocarbon exploration of frontier areas, where no direct geochemical information from drilling is available. To improve knowledge of subsurface structures and the evolution of potential petroleum systems in the northern Barents Sea, seismic data and near-surface sediment samples were collected. Analysis of bound hydrocarbon gases extracted from these sediments revealed concentrations significantly above background in areas along the Hornsund-Knøllega Fault Complex as well as near margins of the Olga Basin. Generally, the compositional and stable carbon isotope signatures of bound gases indicate thermogenic origins from source rocks of oil window maturity for near-surface gases with anomalous high concentrations, whereas for sediments with low concentration of bound gases, mixture of thermogenic and microbial gas is indicated. Amount and composition of bound gas extracted from source rock samples from Spitsbergen indicate that contribution of transported material may have influenced the bound gas in near-surface marine sediment of the Barents Sea in areas where presence of mature organic matter is indicated. In the Knølegga Fault Complex near the western Barents Sea margin high concentrations of thermogenic gas in near-surface sediments are associated with fault-bound basins and most likely originate from the Paleocene-Eocene Torsk Formation. In the Olga Basin higher bound gas concentrations occur near the southern border of the basin corresponding to sub-cropping Late Jurassic – Early Cretaceous shales, whereas elevated concentrations in the northern Olga Basin are associated with reactivated faults, reaching close to the surface. Sediments above the center of the basin show significantly lower bound gas concentrations. These observations indicate that the Jurassic shales act as a regional seal for hydrocarbons and that reactivated faults at the basin margin represent pathways for migration to the surface. 1D basin and petroleum systems modeling for the Olga Basin indicates that Early to Middle Triassic sediments reached oil window maturity and represent the most likely source for thermogenic near-surface gas in that area.",

		"abstract": "Sea ice loss in the Arctic Ocean has up to now been strongest during summer. In contrast, the sea ice concentration north of Svalbard has experienced a larger decline during winter since 1979. The trend in winter ice area loss is close to 10% per decade, and concurrent with a 0.3°C per decade warming of the Atlantic Water entering the Arctic Ocean in this region. Simultaneously, there has been a 2°C per decade warming of winter mean surface air temperature north of Svalbard, which is 20–45% higher than observations on the west coast. Generally, the ice edge north of Svalbard has retreated towards the northeast, along the Atlantic Water pathway. By making reasonable assumptions about the Atlantic Water volume and associated heat transport, we show that the extra oceanic heat brought into the region is likely to have caused the sea ice loss. The reduced sea ice cover leads to more oceanic heat transferred to the atmosphere, suggesting that part of the atmospheric warming is driven by larger open water area. In contrast to significant trends in sea ice concentration, Atlantic Water temperature and air temperature, there is no significant temporal trend in the local winds. Thus, winds have not caused the long-term warming or sea ice loss. However, the dominant winds transport sea ice from the Arctic Ocean into the region north of Svalbard, and the local wind has influence on the year-to-year variability of the ice concentration, which correlates with surface air temperatures, ocean temperatures, as well as the local wind.",

		"abstract": "The sequence of extreme September sea ice extent minima over the past decade suggests acceleration in the response of the Arctic sea ice cover to external forcing, hastening the ongoing transition towards a seasonally open Arctic Ocean. This reflects several mutually supporting processes. Because of the extensive open water in recent Septembers, ice cover in the following spring is increasingly dominated by thin, first-year ice (ice formed during the previous autumn and winter) that is vulnerable to melting out in summer. Thinner ice in spring in turn fosters a stronger summer ice-albedo feedback through earlier formation of open water areas. A thin ice cover is also more vulnerable to strong summer retreat under anomalous atmospheric forcing. Finally, general warming of the Arctic has reduced the likelihood of cold years that could bring about temporary recovery of the ice cover. Events leading to the September ice extent minima of recent years exemplify these processes.",

		"abstract": "<p>Igneous intrusions emplaced during the Early Cretaceous are well exposed in central Spitsbergen within the Permian&ndash;Jurassic sedimentary succession. The doleritic intrusions are collectively classified as the Diabasodden Suite, and form part of the High Arctic Large Igneous Province. Though relatively easily accessible and very well exposed in places, the Diabasodden Suite dolerites remain underexplored and their prevalent geometry is particularly poorly understood. In this contribution we address this deficiency by mapping the distribution of the igneous complexes in both onshore and offshore areas of central Spitsbergen, using an integrated dataset incorporating 2D seismic data with magnetic profiles, highresolution multibeam bathymetric data, digital elevation models, aerial photos, geological maps, a lidar model and fieldwork. The intrusions occur primarily as sills, typically less than 50 m thick but extending over 10 km laterally. Subordinate dykes, transgressive sill segments and saucer-shaped intrusions are also present. Increased structural complexity is evident in the higher parts of the stratigraphy, with sill/dyke interactions relatively common. Some exposed positive relief features on the seafloor are interpreted as resistant dolerite intrusions, based on bathymetric data, 2D seismic lines and magnetic profiles. An increased presence of pockmarks along the rims of these intrusions cropping out at the seafloor suggests a causal relationship between focused fluid flow and igneous intrusions. As well as describing the overall geometry of the igneous complex, we investigate the implications of igneous intrusions for fluid flow within a siliciclastic aquifer, highlighted by a study addressing potential subsurface CO2 storage in central Spitsbergen. Fracture corridors along dykes suggest that fluid flow may be channelled along dykes across the stratigraphy, perhaps leaking into the lower part of the caprock. Furthermore, both enhanced flow along dykes and hampering of flow across dykes may affect the areal distribution of the CO2 plume following injection of CO2 into the affected aquifer.</p>",

		"abstract": "The Billefjorden fault zone (BFZ) of Svalbard, Norway, is a long-lived major tectonic lineament with significant influence on the structural style of the northwestern Barents Shelf. The fault zone can be traced for around 2–300km in an N-S direction, where it is made up of three major fault strands, all dipping 50–70° to the east. Field and seismic data delineate gradual shifts in displacement between master faults (northern Odelfjellet, Balliolbreen, and southern Drønbreen faults) and suggest that two c. 20km long, 2–3km wide relay zones exist along strike. The western fault strand consistently has a pre-Carboniferous reverse character; placing basement on top of Devonian sedimentary units with a throw estimated at 10km. Subsequent Carboniferous extensional reactivation of segments of the BFZ resulted in formation of the Billefjorden Trough, with a rift basin showing a fairly consistent polarity for its length. This suggests a profound control by the older, Devonian reverse faults on the extensional structural style. The Billefjorden Trough extends for a minimum of 110km along strike, and is 20–30km wide at the most. A gentle north plunge of the basin axis in the south is mirrored by an opposite plunge in the north, offering a depth/thickness of around 2000m in the central realm, diminishing to 500m in the south. Geometries of the trough suggest sedimentary response to fault-growth, with weak lithologies such as evaporites promoting fault-monocline formation and associated lenticular basin geometries. On the contrary, wedged shaped fill geometries toward major faults is consistent with significant fault movement and growth sequences. Subsequent mild Tertiary reactivation of fault segments of the BFZ is suggested by local reverse faults and deep-seated anticline-syncline pairs.",

		"abstract": "Stabilizing the concentration of atmospheric CO2 may require storing enormous quantities of captured anthropogenic CO2 in near-permanent geologic reservoirs. Because of the subsurface temperature profile of terrestrial storage sites, CO2 stored in these reservoirs is buoyant. As a result, a portion of the injected CO2 can escape if the reservoir is not appropriately sealed. We show that injecting CO2 into deep-sea sediments <3,000-m water depth and a few hundred meters of sediment provides permanent geologic storage even with large geomechanical perturbations. At the high pressures and low temperatures common in deep-sea sediments, CO2 resides in its liquid phase and can be denser than the overlying pore fluid, causing the injected CO2 to be gravitationally stable. Additionally, CO2 hydrate formation will impede the flow of CO2(l) and serve as a second cap on the system. The evolution of the CO2 plume is described qualitatively from the injection to the formation of CO2 hydrates and finally to the dilution of the CO2(aq) solution by diffusion. If calcareous sediments are chosen, then the dissolution of carbonate host rock by the CO2(aq) solution will slightly increase porosity, which may cause large increases in permeability. Karst formation, however, is unlikely because total dissolution is limited to only a few percent of the rock volume. The total CO2 storage capacity within the 200-mile economic zone of the U.S. coastline is enormous, capable of storing thousands of years of current U.S. CO2 emissions.",

		"abstract": "Subsurface storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is regarded as a short to medium term solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are concerns with respect to the integrity of seals in subsurface storage of CO2 and the risks associated with leakage to ocean and atmosphere. In this paper, we report the results of experimental laboratory simulation of CO2 leakage from subsurface storage sites and the self-sealing mechanism of CO2 hydrates in subsea sediments, using an experimental setup specifically constructed for this work. The results demonstrate that the sequestrated CO2 migrated upward and formed hydrates with the pore water in the sediment when the pressure and temperature conditions in the sediments were inside the hydrate stability zone. The CO2 hydrate formation slowed down the CO2 diffusion rate by several times to 3 orders of magnitude. The upward migrating CO2 tended to form hydrate at the base of the hydrate stability zone. On the geological time scale the CO2 hydrate formation could create a low-permeability secondary cap layer which greatly restricts further upward CO2 flow, should a leakage occurs. This potential “self-sealing” and “self-healing” process could be an important criterion in the selection of suitable sites for geological storage of CO2.",

		"abstract": "It is generally assumed that oceanic gas hydrates contain a huge volume of natural gases, mainly methane. The most widely cited estimate of global hydrate-bound gas is 21×1015 m3 of methane at STP (or ∼10,000 Gt of methane carbon), which is proposed as a “consensus value” from several independent estimations. This large gas hydrate reservoir is further suggested as an important component of the global carbon cycle and as a future energy source. Here, I present a revised and updated set of well-justified global estimates and discuss how and why they changed over time. It appears that the global estimates of hydrate-bound gas decreased by at least one order of magnitude from 1970s–early 1980s (estimates on the order of 1017–1018 m3) to late 1980s–early 1990s (1016 m3) to late 1990s–present (1014–1015 m3). The decrease of estimates is a result of growing knowledge of the distribution and concentration of gas hydrates in marine sediments and ongoing efforts to better constrain the volume of hydrate-bearing sediments and their gas yield. These parameters appear to be relatively well constrained at present through DSDP/ODP drilling and direct measurements of gas concentrations in sediments. The global estimate of hydrate-bound gas that best reflects the current knowledge of submarine gas hydrate is in the range (1–5)×1015 m3 (∼500–2500 Gt of methane carbon). A significantly smaller global gas hydrate inventory implies that the role of gas hydrates in the global carbon cycle may not be as significant as speculated previously. Gas hydrate may be considered a future energy source not because the global volume of hydrate-bound gas is large, but because some individual gas hydrate accumulations may contain significant and concentrated resources that may be profitably recovered in the future.",

		"abstract": "For the past three decades, discussion of naturally-occurring gas hydrates has been framed by a series of assessments that indicate enormous global volumes of methane present within gas hydrate accumulations. At present, these estimates continue to range over several orders of magnitude, creating great uncertainty in assessing those two gas hydrate issues that relate most directly to resource volumes – gas hydrate’s potential as an energy resource and its possible role in ongoing climate change. However, a series of recent field expeditions have provided new insights into the nature of gas hydrate occurrence; perhaps most notably, the understanding that gas hydrates occur in a wide variety of geologic settings and modes of occurrence. These fundamental differences - which include gas hydrate concentration, host lithology, distribution within the sediment matrix, burial depth, water depth, and many others - can now be incorporated into evaluations of gas hydrate energy resource and environmental issues. With regard to energy supply potential, field data combined with advanced numerical simulation have identified gas-hydrate-bearing sands as the most feasible initial targets for energy recovery. The first assessments of potential technically-recoverable resources are now occurring, enabling a preliminary estimate of ultimate global recoverable volumes on the order of ~3 × 1014 m3 (1016 ft3; ∼150 GtC). Other occurrences, such as gas hydrate-filled fractures in clay-dominated reservoirs, may also become potential energy production targets in the future; but as yet, no production concept has been demonstrated. With regard to the climate implications of gas hydrate, an analogous partitioning of global resources to determine that portion most prone to dissociation during specific future warming scenarios is needed. At present, it appears that these two portions of total gas hydrate resources (those that are the most likely targets for gas extraction and those that are the most likely to respond in a meaningful way to climate change) will be largely exclusive, as those deposits that are the most amenable to production (the more deeply buried and localized accumulations) are also those that are the most poorly coupled to oceanic and atmospheric conditions.",

The discovery in 2008 of over 250 plumes of methane gas escaping from the seabed of the West Svalbard continental margin at 400 m water depth (mwd) suggests that hydrate is dissociating in the present-day Arctic. Here we model the dynamic response of hydrate-bearing sediments over a period of 2300 years and investigate ocean warming as a possible cause for present-day and likely future dissociation of hydrate, within 350–800 mwd, west of Svalbard. Future temperatures are given by two climate models, HadGEM2 and CCSM4, and scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5 and 2.6. Our results suggest that over the next three centuries 5.3–29 Gg yr−1 of methane may be released to the Arctic Ocean on the West Svalbard margin.",

		"abstract": "Large quantities of methane are stored in hydrates and permafrost within shallow marine sediments in the Arctic Ocean. These reservoirs are highly sensitive to climate warming, but the fate of methane released from sediments is uncertain. Here, we review the principal physical and biogeochemical processes that regulate methane fluxes across the seabed, the fate of this methane in the water column, and potential for its release to the atmosphere. We find that, at present, fluxes of dissolved methane are significantly moderated by anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of methane. If methane fluxes increase then a greater proportion of methane will be transported by advection or in the gas phase, which reduces the efficiency of the methanotrophic sink. Higher freshwater discharge to Arctic shelf seas may increase stratification and inhibit transfer of methane gas to surface waters, although there is some evidence that increased stratification may lead to warming of sub-pycnocline waters, increasing the potential for hydrate dissociation. Loss of sea-ice is likely to increase wind speeds and sea-air exchange of methane will consequently increase. Studies of the distribution and cycling of methane beneath and within sea ice are limited, but it seems likely that the sea-air methane flux is higher during melting in seasonally ice-covered regions. Our review reveals that increased observations around especially the anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of methane, bubble transport, and the effects of ice cover, are required to fully understand the linkages and feedback pathways between climate warming and release of methane from marine sediments.",

		"abstract": "Sverrefjellet is a Pleistocene-age basaltic volcanic construct on north-western Spitsbergen Island (Svalbard Archipelago, Norway). Published ages for the Sverrefjellet eruption range between 6000 years and ca. 1 million years before present. The age of eruption is dated here as 1.05±0.07 (1σ) My, consistent with Ar–Ar isochron and plateau ages of several analysed samples. Radiogenic Ar represents a small proportion of the released Ar, <15% in nearly all samples. Non-radiogenic Ar components include air, excess 40Ar (seen as inverse isochron intercept values >40Ar/36Ar = 295.5), low-temperature alterations (Ar release at low temperature, with high Cl/K), carbonates and zeolites (Ar release at intermediate temperature) and xenolithic material (Ar release at high temperature, high Ca/K). The effects of the largely non-radiogenic argon sources are also seen in the total-gas Ar–Ar “ages”, which range from 1.3 to 10.3 My, significantly larger than the inferred eruption age. It is likely that total-gas Ar–Ar “ages” and whole-rock K–Ar “ages” of similar basalts also exceed their true eruption ages.To access the supplementary material to this article please see Supplementary files under Article Tools online.",

		"abstract": "Exchanges between oceanic and coastal waters are fundamental in setting the hydrography of arctic shelves and fjords. In West Spitsbergen, Atlantic Water from the West Spitsbergen Current exchanges with the seasonally ice-covered waters of the coast and fjords causing a major annual shift in hydrographic conditions. The extent to which Atlantic Water dominates the fjord systems shows significant interannual variability. Hydrographic sections taken between 1999 and 2005 from Isfjorden and the adjacent shelf have been analyzed to identify the causes of the variability in Atlantic Water occupation of the fjord system. By treating the fjord system as a coastal polynya and running a polynya model to quantify the salt release each winter, we conclude that the critical parameter controlling fjord–shelf exchange is the density difference between the fjord water masses and the Atlantic Water. We provide a full dynamical mechanism for the interaction between water masses at the fjord entrance to rationalize the interannual variability.",

		"abstract": "Gas hydrates have traditionally been viewed as hazardous to petroleum operations, particularly with respect to flow assurance in pipelines and slope stability.They occur where gas migrates through environments characterised by moderate pressures and low temperatures.Gas hydrates thus naturally occur in two main settings, i.e., a deepmarine, offshore setting and a polar, onshore setting associated with permafrost.While nowadays considered a vast potential source of hydrocarbons, stability of gas hydrates in the permafrost setting is being compromised by climate change, with release of even a small fraction of the permafrost-associated hydrates being potentially hazardous.Exploration and quantification of Svalbard's gas hydrate potential is limited compared to other polar regions (e.g., Russia, Alaska, Arctic Canada), even though the archipelago's unique setting makes it even more prone to change.By designing a semi-automated workflow, and incorporating all available data, this work has resulted in the first assessment of the GHSZ for central Spitsbergen.The framework's Python back-end allows for both laterally and vertically changing input parameters, is easily upgradable with both new functions and novel datasets, and provides a link to third-party tools while guaranteeing industry-standard support through Schlumberger's Petrel front-end.Although uncertainties in local temperature and pressure regimes prevent higher-order assessments, a strong correlation is observed between GHSZ and base permafrost.On a regional scale, the vertical extent of the GHSZ is most pronounced in areas with thick layers of permafrost, i.e., highlands and mountains, with the lateral extent governed by trends governing surface and subsurface thermobaric conditions.In Adventdalen, intrapermafrost heterogeneities, wet gas and pressure built-up near the base permafrost, and borderline favourable thermal regimes, make for a likely gas hydrate formation setting.Changes in surface temperature are likely to destabilise a substantial part of the regional GHSZ.The versatility of the workflow has furthermore been shown via an offshore GHSZ modelling effort targeting the Fingerdjupet Subbasin, SW Barents Sea, through a collaboration with the operating company Spirit Energy.",

		"abstract": "Hundreds of newly discovered gas seeps, craters, and mounds are presented from the central Barents Sea, Norway. Where they occur together, the crater-mound pairs have a preferred orientation towards the southeast. According to complex cross-cutting relationships with iceberg ploughmarks, both the craters and mounds formed during deglaciation (ca. 11–13 ka BP). Free gas, trapped beneath shallow gas hydrates in discrete areas, deformed or displaced overlying bedrock and sediment, forming mounds. Over-steepened slopes, weak layers, fractured bedrock, and unstable sediment resulted in small landslides towards the southeast: the direction of regional slope. In some cases, the highly buoyant, hydrate-cored sediment mounds may have instead, detached and floated with bottom currents before being re-deposited, either locally or distally. In this scenario, southeasterly flowing bottom currents would also explain the preferred orientation of the observed crater-mound pairs. Crater collapse would have occurred simultaneously or subsequently to landslide or detachment and floating due to the rapid dissociation of any remaining gas hydrates; a result of attendant regional changes in temperature and pressure following deglaciation and local removal of overlying sediment. The model of formation developed in this study explains the southeasterly trend in crater-mound orientation, but differs from other studies that interpret modern mounds, located elsewhere in the Barents Sea, as gas hydrate-cored.",

		"abstract": "Modern oil and gas exploration on Svalbard has not yet resulted in any commercial discoveries. Is this symptomatic of the area, or may new play concepts and improved exploration techniques change this picture? This is a key question regarding a remote exploration province where, as we judge it, the hydrocarbon potential has barely been tested successfully, despite the recent completion of a 14th wildcat. Post-Devonian sediments cover most of central Spitsbergen south of Isfjorden and east of the West Spitsbergen Orogenic Belt. The basic preconditions for a hydrocarbon discovery seem to be met in general: mature source, reservoir and cap rocks are known to exist and several closed structures have been mapped. Yet, based on tectonic style, basin filling and timing, the prospectivity of different exploration sub-provinces can be clearly discriminated between. Sub-province 1 -– West Spitsbergen Orogenic Belt: The eastern, thin-skinned part of the West Spitsbergen Orogenic Belt (Tertiary) has a limited hydrocarbon potential. Ramp anticlinal structuring within late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic carbonates and clastics produced closures, but strong cementation and tectonic fracturing have partly destroyed reservoir quality and cap rock properties. Sub-province 2 -– Central Spitsbergen Basin, west flank: The west flank and axial part of the Central Spitsbergen Basin foredeep also has a limited potential. Blind anticlinal closures in the late Mesozoic-Tertiary overlie deeper ramp anticlines or thrust duplexes, but with overall poor reservoir quality and cap rock properties. High thermal maturation indicates a gas prone area. Sub-province 3 -– Central Spitsbergen Basin east flank: Improved reservoir quality and maturation profile (north) eastwards are negated by a general lack of larger scale structuring along the east flank of the Central Spitsbergen Basin. Sub-province 4 -– Billefjorden Fault Zone, eastwards: Carboniferous extensional tectonics and fault block rotation produced large closures, and good quality source, reservoir and cap rocks are present in Carboniferous-Permian outcrops. However, thermal maturity varies from oil to gas maturation and reservoir quality is reduced with increasing subsurface depths. Ramp anticlines (Tertiary) above a Mesozoic decollement produce a second play. Oil prone source rocks are present, but structural closures are generally small and reservoir and cap rock properties become a problem. Further eastwards, less structuring reduces the general trap potential. One exception is along the Lomfjorden Fault Zone, where ramp anticlines are also present. Reservoir quality and source rock maturation seem favourable, but present shallow burial reduces the seal potential.",

		"abstract": "Numerous articles have recently reported on gas seepage offshore Svalbard, because the gas emission from these Arctic sediments was thought to result from gas hydrate dissociation, possibly triggered by anthropogenic ocean warming. We report on findings of a much broader seepage area, extending from 74° to 79°, where more than a thousand gas discharge sites were imaged as acoustic flares. The gas discharge occurs in water depths at and shallower than the upper edge of the gas hydrate stability zone and generates a dissolved methane plume that is hundreds of kilometer in length. Data collected in the summer of 2015 revealed that 0.02–7.7% of the dissolved methane was aerobically oxidized by microbes and a minor fraction (0.07%) was transferred to the atmosphere during periods of low wind speeds. Most flares were detected in the vicinity of the Hornsund Fracture Zone, leading us to postulate that the gas ascends along this fracture zone. The methane discharges on bathymetric highs characterized by sonic hard grounds, whereas glaciomarine and Holocene sediments in the troughs apparently limit seepage. The large scale seepage reported here is not caused by anthropogenic warming.",

		"abstract": "Multi-proxy analyses of two sediment cores from central Isfjorden were used to reconstruct the glacial history in central Spitsbergen during the Late Weichselian and the Holocene, and to relate iceberg rafting and sea-ice rafting to climatic and oceanographic changes in the north Atlantic region. A basal till was deposited beneath an ice stream prior to 12,700cal. years BP (calendar years before the present). Several tidewater glaciers influenced the sedimentary environment during the Younger Dryas and probably already during the Allerød. The Younger Dryas cooling might be reflected by enhanced sea-ice formation and suspension settling, as well as reduced iceberg rafting. The final deglaciation was dominated by intense iceberg rafting. It terminated around 11,200cal. years BP. Optimum Holocene climatic and oceanographic conditions with significantly reduced ice rafting occurred between c. 11,200 and 9000cal. years BP. Ice rafting occurred almost exclusively from icebergs after 10,200cal. years BP. The icebergs most probably originated from tidewater glaciers on east Spitsbergen, indicating the presence of a strong east–west temperature gradient at this time. An increase of iceberg rafting around 9000cal. years BP, followed by enhanced sea-ice rafting, reflects the onset of a general cooling in the western Barents Sea–Svalbard region. Comparatively intense rafting from icebergs and sea ice between 9000 and 4000cal. years BP is related to this cooling. A general reduction in ice rafting after 4000cal. years BP is most probably the result of the enhanced formation of shore-fast and/or more permanent sea-ice cover, reducing the drift of icebergs and sea ice in the fjord. The results indicate that the palaeoenvironmental conditions on central Spitsbergen to a large degree depended on the oceanographic conditions in the western Barents Sea and west off Spitsbergen. However, climatic trends affecting Greenland and the entire north Atlantic region can also be identified.",

		"abstract": "Submarine geomorphology is one of the main tools for understanding past fluctuations of tidewater glaciers. In this study we investigate the glacial history of Mohnbukta, on the east coast of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, by combining multibeam-bathymetric data, marine sediment cores and remote sensing data. Presently, three tidewater glaciers, Heuglinbreen, Königsbergbreen and Hayesbreen calve into Mohnbukta. Hayesbreen surged at the end of the Little Ice Age, between 1901 and 1910. The submarine landform assemblage in Mohnbukta contains two large transverse ridges, interpreted as terminal moraines, with debrisflow lobes on their distal slopes and sets of well-preserved geometric networks of ridges, interpreted as crevasse-squeeze ridges inshore of the moraines. The arrangement of crevasse-squeeze ridges suggests that both landform sets were produced during surge-type advances. The terminus position of the 1901–1910 Hayesbreen surge correlates with the inner (R.2) terminal moraine ridge suggesting that the R.1 ridge formed prior to 1901. Marine sediment cores display 14C ages between 5700–7700 cal. a BP derived from benthic foraminifera, from a clast-rich mud unit. This unit represents pre-surge unconsolidated Holocene sediments pushed in front of the glacier terminus and mixed up during the 1901 surge. An absence of retreat moraines in the deeper part of the inner basin and the observation of tabular icebergs calving off the glacier front during retreat suggest that the front of Hayesbreen was close to flotation, at least in the deeper parts of the basin. As the MOH15-01 core does not penetrate into a subglacial till and the foraminifera in the samples were well preserved, the R.1 ridge is suggested to have formed prior to the deposition of the foraminifera. Based on these data we propose that a surge-type advance occurred in Mohnbukta in the early Holocene, prior to 7700 cal. a BP, which in turn indicates that glaciers can switch to and from surge mode.",

		"abstract": "Vaigattbogen is located in northern Svalbard. The area is currently affected by several tidewater glaciers. This study uses multibeam-, sub-bottom acoustic data, and four sediment cores to reconstruct the Late Weichselian and Holocene glacial history in Vaigattbogen. During the last glacial, ice flowed northwards through Vaigattbogen and fed into the Hinlopen Strait Ice Stream. Streamlined bedforms indicate relatively fast ice flow and their increasing elongation ratios towards the north suggest increasing flow velocities. De Geer moraines in the shallower parts of Vaigattbogen imply that multiple halts and/or re-advances interrupted the ice retreat in these areas. A sediment core suggests that the north basin deglaciated prior to 9.1cal.kaBP. In the south basin, two large moraine ridges and networks of crevasse-squeeze ridges suggest that at least two surge-type advances occurred during the Holocene. The Hinlopenbreen glacier surged in the early 1970s and deposited the inner (R.2) of the two large moraine ridges. Radiocarbon ages from a sediment core recovered from the crest of the outer (R.1) ridge yield a basal age of 2.6cal.kaBP. However, the core did not sample subglacial diamict and the age of the ridge could be anything between 2.6cal.kaBP and early Holocene. The R.1 ridge formed prior to the Little Ice Age (LIA), implying that more than one tidewater glacier has experienced a pre-LIA surge on the east coast of Spitsbergen, suggesting that surging during the Holocene was a regional phenomenon. The R.1 ridge is double-crested with small crevasse-squeeze ridges between the crests suggesting that more than one surge-type advance occurred during the Holocene reaching approximately the same location. Data from eastern Svalbard indicate differences in surge-landform assemblages suggesting that different mechanisms could have governed surge-cycles throughout the Holocene.",

Five acoustic-stratigraphic units were distinguished suggesting the presence of a complete glacial–postglacial succession in the central fjord basins. 14C ages from the sediments indicate that the inner Rijpfjorden and central Duvefjorden were deglaciated before ca. 10.6 cal ka BP and 11.0 cal ka BP, respectively. Maximum sediment thickness in Rijpfjorden and Duvefjorden is 26 m, resulting in sediment accumulation rates of ca. 66 cm ka−1. The landform record suggests that the ice streaming in both fjords was topographically controlled. The considerably deeper basin and higher elongation ratios of the crag-and-tails in Duvefjorden are linked to the faulted bedrock and possibly to somewhat larger ice stream and/or more focused ice-flow compared to that in Rijpfjorden. De Geer moraines suggest slower retreat of a grounded ice margin from shallow areas of Rijpfjorden. In deeper areas of the fjords, the glaciers were probably floating, resulting in the lack of ice-marginal transverse landforms. The ice margin retreat from these areas was probably relatively rapid and dominated by calving.",

		"abstract": "<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Methane (<span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span>) is a powerful greenhouse gas. Its atmospheric mixing ratios have been increasing since 2005. Therefore, quantification of <span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span> sources is essential for effective climate change mitigation. Here we report observations of the <span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span> mixing ratios measured at the Zeppelin Observatory (Svalbard) in the Arctic and aboard the research vessel (RV) <i>Helmer Hanssen</i> over the Arctic Ocean from June 2014 to December 2016, as well as the long-term <span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span> trend measured at the Zeppelin Observatory from 2001 to 2017. We investigated areas over the European Arctic Ocean to identify possible hotspot regions emitting <span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span> from the ocean to the atmosphere, and used state-of-the-art modelling (FLEXPART) combined with updated emission inventories to identify <span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span> sources. Furthermore, we collected air samples in the region as well as samples of gas hydrates, obtained from the sea floor, which we analysed using a new technique whereby hydrate gases are sampled directly into evacuated canisters. Using this new methodology, we evaluated the suitability of ethane and isotopic signatures (<span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>δ</i><sup>13</sup>C</span> in <span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span>) as tracers for ocean-to-atmosphere <span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span> emission. We found that the average methane&thinsp;/&thinsp;light hydrocarbon (ethane and propane) ratio is an order of magnitude higher for the same sediment samples using our new methodology compared to previously reported values, 2379.95 vs. 460.06, respectively. Meanwhile, we show that the mean atmospheric <span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span> mixing ratio in the Arctic increased by <span class=\"inline-formula\">5.9±0.38</span> parts per billion by volume (ppb) per year (yr<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>−1</sup></span>) from 2001 to 2017 and <span class=\"inline-formula\">∼8</span>&thinsp;pbb&thinsp;yr<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>−1</sup></span> since 2008, similar to the global trend of <span class=\"inline-formula\">∼</span>&thinsp;7–8&thinsp;ppb&thinsp;yr<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>−1</sup></span>. Most large excursions from the baseline <span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span> mixing ratio over the European Arctic Ocean are due to long-range transport from land-based sources, lending confidence to the present inventories for high-latitude <span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span> emissions. However, we also identify a potential hotspot region with ocean–atmosphere <span class=\"inline-formula\">CH<sub>4</sub></span> flux north of Svalbard (80.4<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>∘</sup></span>&thinsp;N, 12.8<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>∘</sup></span>&thinsp;E) of up to 26&thinsp;nmol&thinsp;m<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>−2</sup></span>&thinsp;s<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>−1</sup></span> from a large mixing ratio increase at the location of 30&thinsp;ppb. Since this flux is consistent with previous constraints (both spatially and temporally), there is no evidence that the area of interest north of Svalbard is unique in the context of the wider Arctic. Rather, because the meteorology at the time of the observation was unique in the context of the measurement time series, we obtained over the short course of the episode measurements highly sensitive to emissions over an active seep site, without sensitivity to land-based emissions.</p>",

		"abstract": "The distribution of gas hydrate on a continental slope is often characterized as a wedge that pinches out on the seafloor. This part of the hydrate stability zone is particularly relevant for studies of the dynamics of hydrate accumulations, such as processes related to slope stability or hydrate dissociation leading to methane release into the overlying ocean. For regions with very low geothermal gradients, we have produced a series of thermobaric models of the shallow hydrate stability zone that contain an unexpected geometrical distribution of hydrated sediments. In these models, the shallowest part of the stability field thickens and bulges landward. Such a feature is more likely to happen in regions where low geothermal gradients are further lowered by high sedimentation rates. Also, the effect is greater beneath colder oceans. Although a hydrate stability zone bulge would be difficult to image with conventional seismic methods, there are numerous locations around the world where such a system could develop.",

		"abstract": "The dissociation of marine hydrate that surrounds continental margins is thought to be an agent for past and future climate change. As the water depth decreases landwards, the base of the hydrate stability zone progressively shallows until hydrate can occur at or immediately below the seabed where an increase in bottom water temperature can cause dissociation. But the true extent of these most vulnerable hydrate deposits is unknown. Here we use exceptional quality three-dimensional (3-D) seismic reflection imagery offshore of Mauritania that reveals a rare example of a bottom simulating reflection (BSR) that intersects the seabed and delineates the feather-edge of hydrate. The BSR intersects the seabed at the ∼636 m isobath but along the 32 km of the margin analysed, the intersection is highly irregular. Intersections and seismic evidence for hydrate less than ∼4.3 m below the seabed occur in seven small, localised areas that are 0.02–0.45 km2 in extent. We propose gas flux below the dipping base of the hydrate to these places has been particularly effective. The intersections are separated by recessions in the BSR where it terminates below the seabed, seawards of the 636 m isobath. Recessions are areas where the concentration of hydrate is very low or hydrate is absent. They are regions that have been bypassed by gas that has migrated landwards along the base of the hydrate or via hydraulic fractures that pass vertically through the hydrate stability zone and terminate at pockmarks at the seabed. An irregular feather-edge of marine hydrate may be typical of other margins.",

		"abstract": "The thermal springs Trollosen and Fisosen, located on the High Arctic archipelago Svalbard, discharge saline groundwaters rich in hydrogen sulfide and ammonium through a thick layer of permafrost. Large amounts of biomass that consist of filamentous microorganisms containing sulfur granules, as analyzed with energy dispersive X-ray analysis, were found in the outflow. Prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene libraries and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses reported bacteria of the γ- and ɛ-proteobacterial classes as the dominant organisms in the filaments and the planktonic fractions, closely related to known chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizers (Thiotrix and Sulfurovum). Archaea comprised ∼1% of the microbial community, with the majority of sequences affiliated with the Thaumarchaeota. Archaeal and bacterial genes coding for a subunit of the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) were detected, as well as 16S rRNA genes of Nitrospira, all of which is indicative of potential complete nitrification in both springs. 16S rRNA sequences related to methanogens and methanotrophs were detected as well. This study provides evidence that the microbial communities in Trollosen and Fisosen are sustained by chemolithotrophy, mainly through the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds, and that ammonium and methane might be minor, additional sources of energy and carbon.

		"abstract": "The status of seismic exploration work mapping the post-Caledonian strata in the Svalbard area is presented. Compressional wave velocities are very high throughout the area, around 4 km/s in the Tertiary and Mesozoic layers. In the Permian section velocities exceed 5 km/s, with refraction velocities > 6 km/s in the calcareous rocks of the Gipsdalen Group (early Permian/Late Carboniferous). Apart from correlation with carbonate and chert lithology, high velocities reflect the high degree of consolidation and the low porosities of shales and sandstones in the post-Caledonian strata in Svalbard. In van Mjenfjorden seismic reflection events are observed down to 3-4 km depth and associated with Carboniferous and younger strata. The thickness of the Mesozoic layers in this part of the central Spitsbergen syncline seems to be greater than previously suggested, and there is an apparent eastward divergence between the Jurassic and the Triassic reflectors. In south-western Storfjorden, reflections interpreted to originate from Carboniferous and Permian strata might represent the seaward extension of the central Spitsbergen syncline. In the northern part of Storfjorden, carbonate layers within the Gipsdalen Group are interpreted to lie about one kilometre below the sea floor. A prominent fault zone in this area trends NNW-SSE, like the main structural elements on Spitsbergen. It shows block-faulting, presumably caused by extensional movement in late Devonian-Carboniferous time.",

(p. 284, published online 2 January) present a record of methane seepage from marine sediments off the coast of Svalbard showing that such emissions have been present for at least 3000 years, the result of normal seasonal fluctuations of bottom waters. Thus, contemporary observations of strong methane venting do not necessarily mean that the clathrates that are the source of the methane are decomposing at a faster rate than in the past.\nMethane hydrate is an icelike substance that is stable at high pressure and low temperature in continental margin sediments. Since the discovery of a large number of gas flares at the landward termination of the gas hydrate stability zone off Svalbard, there has been concern that warming bottom waters have started to dissociate large amounts of gas hydrate and that the resulting methane release may possibly accelerate global warming. Here, we corroborate that hydrates play a role in the observed seepage of gas, but we present evidence that seepage off Svalbard has been ongoing for at least 3000 years and that seasonal fluctuations of 1° to 2°C in the bottom-water temperature cause periodic gas hydrate formation and dissociation, which focus seepage at the observed sites.\nSeasonal gas hydrate destabilization has been releasing methane from marine sediments near Svalbard for at least 3000 years.\nSeasonal gas hydrate destabilization has been releasing methane from marine sediments near Svalbard for at least 3000 years.",

		"abstract": "While bubble plumes have been acoustically imaged in the water column above marine gas hydrate deposits in many studies, little is known about the temporal variation in plume intensity. In July 2008, we conducted surveys using 3.5 and 12kHz echosounders and a 75kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) over the northern and southern summits of Hydrate Ridge, on the Cascadia continental margin. Our study included multiple surveys at both sites, including a survey of the northern summit that was repeated 16 times in 19h. Seafloor depth at the northern summit is ~600m, well within the hydrate stability zone (HSZ), which was below ~510m during our survey based on CTD data. Three distinct flares (a term used to denote the acoustic signature of bubble plumes) were detected at Northern Hydrate Ridge (NHR) and one was detected at Southern Hydrate Ridge (SHR), coincident with where flares were observed a decade ago, indicating that the supply of gas is stable on this time scale. High-resolution bathymetric surveys of NHR and SHR acquired with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) flown ~50m above the seafloor indicate that flare locations are correlated with a distinctive pattern of short-wavelength seafloor roughness, supporting the inference of long-term stability in the location of bubble expulsion sites. As in previous studies at Hydrate Ridge, flares were not detected with the 3.5kHz echosounder but were clearly imaged at 12kHz. By reprocessing routine shipboard ADCP data, we show that they are also observed in at 75kHz, indicating that a wide range of bubble sizes is present. The intensity of the flares varied strongly with time. Two primary sources for flares were observed. One, located on the regional topographic high, showed continuous activity, with two times periods of particularly strong flares that are not correlated with tidal height. The other, located on a local topographic high, shows a pulse of increased backscatter that occurred on a falling tide. While the time period of observation is not enough to constrain the effect of tidal changes in seafloor pressure on venting, the data suggest that tides are not the dominant factor controlling release of bubbles from the seafloor. The data support previously suggested models in which temporary sealing of vents by gas hydrate formation and breaking of these barriers as gas pressure builds up is responsible for “burp-like” pulses of gas expulsion. We also report the first observations of flares originating within the HSZ that extend well above the HSZ with little loss of backscatter intensity. These represent a new source of methane injection into the upper ocean and possibly the atmosphere. Flare extension above the HSZ may be due to coating of some bubbles by oil or biofilms or to inclusion of particulate matter (possibly including floating pieces of hydrate) in the plumes. Although this study provides tantalizing new information on both short-term variability in gas expulsion rate and long-term stability of vent sites, longer, well-calibrated observations that integrate bubble flux over entire vent fields as a function of time are needed to develop accurate models for the flux of methane into the ocean and atmosphere from seafloor methane vents.",

		"abstract": "AbstractWe investigate the response of relict Arctic submarine permafrost and gas hydrate deposits to warming and make predictions of methane gas flux to the water column using a 2-D multiphase fluid flow model. Exposure of the Arctic shelf during the last glacial cycle formed a thick layer of permafrost, protecting hydrate deposits below. However, talik formation below paleo-river channels creates permeable pathways for gas migration from depth. An estimate of the maximum gas flux at the present time for conditions at the East Siberian Arctic Seas is 0.2047 kg yr−1 m−2, which produces a methane concentration of 142 nM in the overlying water column, consistent with several field observations. For conditions at the North American Beaufort Sea, the maximum gas flux at the present time is 0.1885 kg yr−1 m−2, which produces a methane concentration of 78 nM in the overlying water column. Shallow sediments are charged with residual methane gas after venting events. Sustained submergence into the future should increase gas venting rate roughly exponentially as sediments continue to warm. Studying permafrost-associated gas hydrate reservoirs will allow us to better understand the Arctic's contribution to the global methane budget and global warming.",

Here, we show that more than 5000 at-sea observations of dissolved methane demonstrates that greater than 80% of ESAS bottom waters and greater than 50% of surface waters are supersaturated with methane regarding to the atmosphere. The current atmospheric venting flux, which is composed of a diffusive component and a gradual ebullition component, is on par with previous estimates of methane venting from the entire World Ocean. Leakage of methane through shallow ESAS waters needs to be considered in interactions between the biogeosphere and a warming Arctic climate.\nMethane emissions from this region of sub-sea permafrost are comparable to previous estimates for the world ocean.\nMethane emissions from this region of sub-sea permafrost are comparable to previous estimates for the world ocean.",

		"abstract": "Vast amounts of methane hydrates are potentially stored in sediments along the continental margins, owing their stability to low temperature – high pressure conditions. Global warming could destabilize these hydrates and cause a release of methane (CH4) into the water column and possibly the atmosphere. Since the Arctic has and will be warmed considerably, Arctic bottom water temperatures and their future evolution projected by a climate model were analyzed. The resulting warming is spatially inhomogeneous, with the strongest impact on shallow regions affected by Atlantic inflow. Within the next 100 years, the warming affects 25% of shallow and mid-depth regions containing methane hydrates. Release of methane from melting hydrates in these areas could enhance ocean acidification and oxygen depletion in the water column. The impact of methane release on global warming, however, would not be significant within the considered time span.",

We review key environmental factors and mechanisms that determine formation, current dynamics, and thermal state of subsea permafrost, mechanisms of its destabilization, and rates of its thawing; a full section of this paper is devoted to this topic. Another important question regards the possible existence of permafrost-related hydrates at shallow ground depth and in the shallow shelf environment. We review the history of and earlier insights about the topic followed by an extensive review of experimental work to establish the physics of shallow Arctic hydrates. We also provide a principal (simplified) scheme explaining the normal and altered dynamics of the permafrost&ndash;hydrate system as glacial&ndash;interglacial climate epochs alternate. We also review specific features of methane releases determined by the current state of the subsea-permafrost system and possible future dynamics. This review presents methane results obtained in the ESAS during two periods: 1994&ndash;2000 and 2003&ndash;2017. A final section is devoted to discussing future work that is required to achieve an improved understanding of the subject.",

		"abstract": "Sequestration of CO2 in a saline aquifer is currently being evaluated as a possible way to handle CO2 emitted from a coal-fueled power plant in Svalbard. The chosen reservoir is a 300-m thick, laterally extensive, shallow marine formation of late Triassic-mid Jurassic age, located below Longyearbyen in Svalbard. The reservoir consists of 300 m of alternating sandstone and shale and is sealed by 400 m of shale. Experimental and numerical studies have been performed to evaluate CO2 storage capacity. A total of 51 samples of core material from one well (Dh4) were collected and tested to find the potential units for CO2 injection. Analysis of the results shows that the permeability is generally less than 2 millidarcies and the capillary entry pressure is high. This poses a serious challenge with respect to achieving practical levels of injectivity and injection pressure. For further investigation, two 32-cm-long sandstone samples from the depth 675 m (Sample 1) and 679 m (Sample 2) were selected for laboratory core flooding experiments at reservoir conditions. This review presents the experimental protocol and detailed CO2-brine drainage and imbibition relative permeability data for these two different samples of rock. Capillary pressure measurements and simulation of the transient process was used to support the interpolation of the experimental flooding data. Initial x-ray computed tomography scan showed no sign of fractures inside the cores, whereas after the core flooding experiment, there were visible fractures especially in Sample 1. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed a high proportion of diagenetic iron-minerals in the sandstones like Fe-chlorite, Fe-carbonate (FeCO3), and pyrite (FeS2). A brownish output flow was seen in the sample with highest porosity and permeability. Dissolution of CO2 in the brine forms a weak acid that reacts with iron-minerals (e.g. siderite) to form iron-hydroxides. Severe hysteresis effects on one of the samples most likely resulted from changes in the rock composition.",

		"abstract": "Spitsbergen has experienced some of the most severe temperature changes in the Arctic during the last three decades. This study relates the recent warming to variations in large-scale atmospheric circulation (AC), air mass characteristics, and sea ice concentration (SIC), both regionally around Spitsbergen and locally in three fjords. We find substantial warming for all AC patterns for all seasons, with greatest temperature increase in winter. A major part of the warming can be attributed to changes in air mass characteristics associated with situations of both cyclonic and anticyclonic air advection from north and east and situations with a nonadvectional anticyclonic ridge. In total, six specific AC types (out of 21), which occur on average 41% of days in a year, contribute approximately 80% of the recent warming. The relationship between the land-based surface air temperature (SAT) and local and regional SIC was highly significant, particularly for the most contributing AC types. The high correlation between SAT and SIC for air masses from east and north of Spitsbergen suggests that a major part of the atmospheric warming observed in Spitsbergen is driven by heat exchange from the larger open water area in the Barents Sea and region north of Spitsbergen. Finally, our results show that changes in frequencies of AC play a minor role to the total recent surface warming. Thus, the strong warming in Spitsbergen in the latest decades is not driven by increased frequencies of “warm” AC types but rather from sea ice decline, higher sea surface temperatures, and a general background warming.",

The maximum fast ice coverage of Isfjorden is &gt; 40 % in the periods 2000–2005 and 2009–2011 and stays &lt; 30 % in 2006–2008 and 2012–2014. Fast ice cover in Hornsund reaches &gt; 40 % in all considered years, except for 2012 and 2014, where the maximum stays &lt; 20 %. The mean seasonal cycles of fast ice in Isfjorden and Hornsund show monthly averaged values of less than 1 % between July and November and maxima in March (Isfjorden, 35.7 %) and April (Hornsund, 42.1 %), respectively. A significant reduction of the monthly averaged fast ice coverage is found when comparing the time periods 2000–2005 and 2006–2014. The seasonal maximum decreases from 57.5 to 23.2 % in Isfjorden and from 52.6 to 35.2 % in Hornsund. A new index, called \"days of fast ice\" (DFI), is introduced for quantification of the interannual variation of fast ice cover, allowing for comparison between different fjords and winter seasons. Considering the time period from 1 March until end of the sea ice season, the mean DFI values for 2000–2014 are 33.1 ± 18.2 DFI (Isfjorden) and 42.9 ± 18.2 DFI (Hornsund). A distinct shift to lower DFI values is observed in 2006. Calculating a mean before and after 2006 yields a decrease from 50 to 22 DFI for Isfjorden and from 56 to 34 DFI for Hornsund. Fast ice coverage generally correlates well with remote-sensing sea surface temperature and in situ air temperature. An increase of autumn ocean heat content is observed during the last few years when the DFI values decrease. The presented sea ice time series can be utilized for various climate effect studies linked to, e.g. glacier dynamics, ocean chemistry, and marine biology.</p>",

		"abstract": "From 2007 to 2015, eight wells were drilled and fully cored to test the feasibility of storing CO2 emitted from the coal-fueled power plant in Longyearbyen, Svalbard. The drilling campaign identified three water-bearing sandstone aquifers; i) a lower aquifer in Upper Triassic strata; ii) a middle aquifer in Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic; and iii) an upper aquifer in Lower Cretaceous strata. Only the two former are regarded as potential CO2 storage units. Both units are unconventional reservoirs (storage units) consisting of fractured, low-porosity and low-permeability sandstones. The storage units are capped by a c. 400 m-thick Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous mudstone-dominated succession, which acts as an efficient top seal. In addition, a c. 120 m-thick zone of permafrost provides an additional seal. Apart from characterising the CO2 storage and cap-rock system, the drilling resulted in several unexpected results. These include: (a) the detection of severe underpressure of approximately 50 bar in the two storage units, (b) the discovery of gravity-flow deposits attributed to a hitherto unknown Hauterivian clastic wedge, and (c) the detection of producible thermogenic shale gas at a depth of 640 to 700 m. Moreover, core and wireline data from the wells combined with correlation to equivalent strata in nearby outcrops provide new insights into the age and depositional evolution of the succession. Thus, the data obtained from this project contributes to the regional stratigraphic understanding of the Mesozoic succession in Svalbard and the northern Barents Shelf. Until now, nearly 70 papers have been published in international peer-reviewed journals using data from or part of the Longyearbyen CO2 Laboratory. In addition, 13 PhD candidates and 27 master students, linked to the project or using obtained data from the project, have graduated. The main achievement of our studies is that we have shown that unconventional fractured reservoirs are suitable for storing CO2.",

We here present new drillcore and outcrop data and refined sedimentological and sequence-stratigraphic interpretations from western central Spitsbergen in and around the main potential CO2-storage area. The Wilhelmøya Subgroup encompasses a relatively thin (15–24 m) siliciclastic succession of mudstones, sandstones and conglomerates and represents an unconventional potential reservoir unit due to its relatively poor reservoir properties, i.e., low-moderate porosity and low permeability. Thirteen sedimentary facies were identified in the succession and subsequently grouped into five facies associations, reflecting deposition in various marginal marine to partly sediment-starved, shallow shelf environments. Palynological analysis was performed to determine the age and aid in the correlation between outcrop and subsurface sections. The palynological data allow identification of three unconformity-bounded sequences (sequence 1–3). These sequences record intermittent deposition in the Early Norian, Early–Middle Toarcian, and Late Toarcian–Aalenian, interrupted by extended periods of erosion, bypass and/or non-deposition. The stratigraphically condensed development of the Wilhelmøya Subgroup in western central Spitsbergen is interpreted to be the result of very low subsidence rates coupled with a physiographic setting characterised by a very gentle depositional gradient. This facilitated rapid shoreline shifts in response to even relatively modest variations in relative sea level with considerable influence on the resulting depositional patterns. We present a revised depositional model for the regionally distinct Brentskardhaugen Bed at the top of the Wilhelmøya Subgroup involving condensation and partial reworking of a series of Upper Toarcian–Aalenian, high-frequency sequences. Coarse-grained extraformational fractions observed within conglomerates of the Wilhelmøya Subgroup are suggested to have been supplied from uplifted and exposed margins to the west (northern Greenland) and north (northern Svalbard).",

		"abstract": "The Longyearbyen CO2 storage project drilling and coring campaign in central Spitsbergen provided new insights on the shale-dominated Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Agardhfjellet Formation, which is the onshore counterpart to the Fuglen Formation and the prolific source rocks of the Hekkingen Formation in the Barents Sea. Logs of magnetic susceptibility, organic carbon content, organic carbon isotopes and XRF geochemistry on the cores, together with wireline logs, biostratigraphy and sedimentology, have made it possible to refine the interpretation of the depositional environment and to identify transgressive-regressive (TR) sequences. Several key sequence-stratigraphic surfaces are identified and suggested to be correlative in Central Svalbard, and four of them, although not necessarily chronostratigraphic, also to surfaces in the Barents Sea. Due to the nearly flat-lying thrust faults in the upper décollement zone of the West Spitsbergen Fold and Thrust Belt, there is some concern about the lateral correlation of the sequences within Spitsbergen. However, some of the TR sequence surfaces appear to be of regional importance and are recognised both onshore Svalbard and offshore on the Barents Shelf. The observations suggest a shallow-marine shelf depositional environment within an epicontinental sea with variable dysoxic, anoxic and oxic sea-floor conditions. The majority of the facies vary from outer shelf to transition zone or prodelta and lower shoreface/distal delta front. In one outcrop, proximal facies, i.e., delta front or middle shoreface, are recognised. In our study area the nearly 250 m-thick, fine-grained Agardhfjellet Formation is proposed to represent distal shoreline clinoforms and a precursor to the overlying forward- and southward-stepping wedge of the Valanginian Rurikfjellet Formation and the Barremian to Early Aptian Helvetiafjellet Formation.",

		"abstract": "The Lower Cretaceous succession in Svalbard is commonly considered as an important analogue to age-equivalent strata on the Barents Shelf which are sporadically targeted by exploration wells. In this study, the stratigraphic and genetic relationship between the Rurikfjellet (open marine), Helvetiafjellet (paralic) and Carolinefjellet (open marine) formations of the Lower Cretaceous succession in Svalbard is evaluated by combining sedimentological outcrop studies with well log and core data across Nordenskiöld Land, central Spitsbergen. Sedimentological characteristics and stratigraphic units are mapped within a refined dinocyst biostratigraphic framework, enabling relatively well-constrained palaeogeographic reconstructions. The Valanginian–lowermost Barremian Rurikfjellet Formation consists of a lower shale-dominated unit of offshore origin which grades upwards into storm-reworked lower shoreface sandstones displaying hummocky cross-stratification. Local occurrences of prodeltaic successions and thick successions of gravity flow deposits containing coal-bearing slump blocks of delta plain origin in some wells, reveal a late Hauterivian progradational pulse which has previously not been recorded in Svalbard. The lower Barremian– lower Aptian Helvetiafjellet Formation consists of fluvial braidplain and paralic deposits which rest unconformably on the Rurikfjellet Formation across the entire study area, reflecting regional uplift and widespread subaerial exposure prior to the onset of paralic deposition. The Helvetiafjellet Formation exhibits increased marine influence upwards, and in the investigated cores the uppermost part of the unit consists of wave-reworked mouth-bar deposits which are truncated by a transgressive conglomerate lag dominated by extrabasinal lithic clasts and intraformational siderite clasts. An up to 10 m-thick, regionally extensive, organic-rich (TOC up to 2.1 wt.%) shale unit of early Aptian age marks the base of the overlying Carolinefjellet Formation. The shale accumulated during a regional flooding event which drowned and eventually transformed the Helvetiafjellet Formation coastal plain into a shallow shelf. The organic facies of the shale unit (Type II–III kerogen) and a high Pr/Ph ratio (>2), in combination with abundant long-chained n-alkanes, suggest that the unit was deposited in a suboxic paralic marine environment strongly influenced by input of terrestrial organic matter. The investigated succession exhibits stratigraphic and petrographic resemblance to age-equivalent strata in NE Greenland, suggesting that these successions may have formed part of the same drainage system located on the northwestern margin of the Barents Shelf. Thus, by highlighting the Early Cretaceous palaeogeographic evolution in Svalbard, this study contributes to the regional stratigraphic understanding of the Lower Cretaceous succession on the wider northern Barents Shelf",

The target siliciclastic storage unit, which is encountered at approx. 670 m depth at the potential injection site in Adventdalen, central Spitsbergen, is a severely under-pressured (at least 35 bar), tight and compartmentalised reservoir with significant contribution of natural fractures to permeability. In this contribution, we characterise the 15–24 m-thick Wilhelmøya Subgroup storage unit using both borehole and outcrop data and present water-injection test results that indicate the presence of fluid-flow barriers and the generation of new, and propagation of pre-existing natural fractures during injection. Whole core samples from drillcores and outcrops were sampled for pore network characterisation and analysed using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (Micro-CT). We demonstrate that heterogeneities such as structural discontinuities, igneous bodies and lateral facies variations, as examined in well core and equivalent outcrops, will strongly influence fluid flow in the target reservoir, both by steering and baffling fluid migration. Many of these heterogeneities are considered to be subseismic, and their detailed characterisation is important to predict subsurface CO2 storage potential and optimise injection strategy.",

		"abstract": "High-resolution topographic surveying is traditionally associated with high capital and logistical costs, so that data acquisition is often passed on to specialist third party organisations. The high costs of data collection are, for many applications in the earth sciences, exacerbated by the remoteness and inaccessibility of many field sites, rendering cheaper, more portable surveying platforms (i.e. terrestrial laser scanning or GPS) impractical. This paper outlines a revolutionary, low-cost, user-friendly photogrammetric technique for obtaining high-resolution datasets at a range of scales, termed ‘Structure-from-Motion’ (SfM). Traditional softcopy photogrammetric methods require the 3-D location and pose of the camera(s), or the 3-D location of ground control points to be known to facilitate scene triangulation and reconstruction. In contrast, the SfM method solves the camera pose and scene geometry simultaneously and automatically, using a highly redundant bundle adjustment based on matching features in multiple overlapping, offset images. A comprehensive introduction to the technique is presented, followed by an outline of the methods used to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from extensive photosets obtained using a consumer-grade digital camera. As an initial appraisal of the technique, an SfM-derived DEM is compared directly with a similar model obtained using terrestrial laser scanning. This intercomparison reveals that decimetre-scale vertical accuracy can be achieved using SfM even for sites with complex topography and a range of land-covers. Example applications of SfM are presented for three contrasting landforms across a range of scales including; an exposed rocky coastal cliff; a breached moraine-dam complex; and a glacially-sculpted bedrock ridge. The SfM technique represents a major advancement in the field of photogrammetry for geoscience applications. Our results and experiences indicate SfM is an inexpensive, effective, and flexible approach to capturing complex topography.",

The technique is not limited in temporal frequency and can provide point cloud data comparable in density and accuracy to those generated by terrestrial and airborne laser scanning at a fraction of the cost. It therefore offers exciting opportunities to characterise surface topography in unprecedented detail and, with multi-temporal data, to detect elevation, position and volumetric changes that are symptomatic of earth surface processes. This book firstly places Structure from Motion in the context of other digital surveying methods and details the Structure from Motion workflow including available software packages and assessments of uncertainty and accuracy. It then critically reviews current usage of Structure from Motion in the geosciences, provides a synthesis of recent validation studies and looks to the future by highlighting opportunities arising from developments in allied disciplines. This book will appeal to academics, students and industry professionals because it balances technical knowledge of the Structure from Motion workflow with practical guidelines for image acquisition, image processing and data quality assessment and includes case studies that have been contributed by experts from around the world.",

		"abstract": "Shallow drilling hazard assessment consists of geological/geophysical review of drill sites to enable the avoidance or effective mitigation of problems that can affect the safe drilling of the “top-hole” section of wells. Primary seafloor hazards include infrastructure, hardgrounds, chemosynthetic communities, and areas of high slope or potential seafloor instability. Shallow subsurface hazards include strata that may contain overpressured water, free gas, or gas hydrate. Among these issues, the potential hazards posed by gas hydrate have historically been the most difficult to quantify and constrain. This paper reviews the history of gas hydrate shallow hazard assessment, much of which has been framed by difficulties in remote detection and quantification of typical low-saturation, mud-hosted hydrate occurrences. Recent drilling results indicate that such accumulations can be safely drilled using existing industry protocols. However, assessment of drilling hazards associated with high saturation, sand-hosted hydrates warrant further investigation, and therefore was a key focus of the Gulf of Mexico Gas Hydrate Joint Industry Project Leg II (JIP Leg II) program conducted in 2009. Pre-drill site hazard assessment for JIP Leg II utilized standard industry methods in which geohazards associated with gas hydrate and free gas were identified in a primarily-qualitative manner using seismic amplitude analysis, seismic stratigraphic interpretation, and geo-pressure analysis. While these methods can reliably detect shallow hydrocarbons, including highly-concentrated gas hydrates, they are not sufficient to determine if free gas may exist below gas hydrate, particularly where they occur in close vertical succession. Such undetected free gas occurrences can pose potential drilling hazards that can be quantitatively assessed using advanced seismic methods.",

		"abstract": "Large quantities of methane are stored in hydrates and permafrost within shallow marine sediments in the Arctic Ocean. These reservoirs are highly sensitive to climate warming, but the fate of methane released from sediments is uncertain. Here, we review the principal physical and biogeochemical processes that regulate methane fluxes across the seabed, the fate of this methane in the water column, and potential for its release to the atmosphere. We find that, at present, fluxes of dissolved methane are significantly moderated by anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of methane. If methane fluxes increase then a greater proportion of methane will be transported by advection or in the gas phase, which reduces the efficiency of the methanotrophic sink. Higher freshwater discharge to Arctic shelf seas may increase stratification and inhibit transfer of methane gas to surface waters, although there is some evidence that increased stratification may lead to warming of sub-pycnocline waters, increasing the potential for hydrate dissociation. Loss of sea-ice is likely to increase wind speeds and sea-air exchange of methane will consequently increase. Studies of the distribution and cycling of methane beneath and within sea ice are limited, but it seems likely that the sea-air methane flux is higher during melting in seasonally ice-covered regions. Our review reveals that increased observations around especially the anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of methane, bubble transport, and the effects of ice cover, are required to fully understand the linkages and feedback pathways between climate warming and release of methane from marine sediments.",

		"abstract": "Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas in the atmosphere next to carbon dioxide. Its global warming potential (GWP) for a time horizon of 100 years is 25, which makes it an attractive target for climate mitigation policies. Although the methane GWP traditionally includes the methane indirect effects on the concentrations of ozone and stratospheric water vapour, it does not take into account the production of carbon dioxide from methane oxidation. We argue here that this CO2-induced effect should be included for fossil sources of methane, which results in slightly larger GWP values for all time horizons. If the global temperature change potential is used as an alternative climate metric, then the impact of the CO2-induced effect is proportionally much larger. We also discuss what the correction term should be for methane from anthropogenic biogenic sources.",

		"abstract": "The geological factors controlling gas release from Arctic deep-water gas reservoirs through seabed methane seeps are poorly constrained. This is partly due to limited data on the precise chronology of past methane emission episodes. Here, we use uranium-thorium dating of seep carbonates sampled from the seabed and from cores drilled at the Vestnesa Ridge, off West Svalbard (79°N, ~1200 m water depth). The carbonate ages reveal three emission episodes during the Penultimate Glacial Maximum (~160,000 to 133,000 years ago), during an interstadial in the last glacial (~50,000 to 40,000 years ago), and in the aftermath of the Last Glacial Maximum (~20,000 to 5,000 years ago), respectively. This chronology suggests that glacial tectonics induced by ice sheet fluctuations on Svalbard mainly controlled methane release from Vestnesa Ridge. Data corroborate past methane release in response to Northern Hemisphere cryosphere variations and suggest that Arctic deep-water gas reservoirs are sensitive to temperature variations over Quaternary time scales.\nLate Quaternary Northern Hemisphere ice volume variations influenced deep-sea methane release.\nLate Quaternary Northern Hemisphere ice volume variations influenced deep-sea methane release.",

Geochemical measurements of gas from hydrates collected at the ridge revealed a thermogenic source. The presence of thermogenic gas and temperatures of ∼3.3°C result in a shallow top of the hydrate stability zone (THSZ) at ∼340 m below sea level (mbsl). Therefore, hydrate-skinned gas bubbles, which inhibit gas-dissolution processes, are thermodynamically stable to this shallow water depth. This was confirmed by hydroacoustic observations of flares in 2010 and 2012 reaching water depths between 210 and 480 mbsl. At the seafloor, bubbles are released from acoustically transparent zones in the seismic data, which we interpret as regions where free gas is migrating through the hydrate stability zone (HSZ). These intrusions result in vertical variations in the base of the HSZ (BHSZ) of up to ∼150 m, possibly making the shallow hydrate reservoir more susceptible to warming. Such Arctic gas-hydrate and free-gas systems are important because of their potential role in climate change and in fueling marine life, but remain largely understudied due to limited data coverage in seasonally ice-covered Arctic environments.",

		"abstract": "The present study is the first to directly address the issue of gas hydrates offshore West Greenland, where numerous occurrences of shallow hydrocarbons have been documented in the vicinity of Disko Bugt (Bay). Furthermore, decomposing gas hydrate has been implied to explain seabed features in this climate-sensitive area. The study is based on archive data and new (2011, 2012) shallow seismic and sediment core data. Archive seismic records crossing an elongated depression (20×35 km large, 575 m deep) on the inner shelf west of Disko Bugt (Bay) show a bottom simulating reflector (BSR) within faulted Mesozoic strata, consistent with the occurrence of gas hydrates. Moreover, the more recently acquired shallow seismic data reveal gas/fluid-related features in the overlying sediments, and geochemical data point to methane migration from a deeper-lying petroleum system. By contrast, hydrocarbon signatures within faulted Mesozoic strata below the strait known as the Vaigat can be inferred on archive seismics, but no BSR was visible. New seismic data provide evidence of various gas/fluid-releasing features in the overlying sediments. Flares were detected by the echo-sounder in July 2012, and cores contained ikaite and showed gas-releasing cracks and bubbles, all pointing to ongoing methane seepage in the strait. Observed seabed mounds also sustain gas seepages. For areas where crystalline bedrock is covered only by Pleistocene–Holocene deposits, methane was found only in the Egedesminde Dyb (Trough). There was a strong increase in methane concentration with depth, but no free gas. This is likely due to the formation of gas hydrate and the limited thickness of the sediment infill. Seabed depressions off Ilulissat Isfjord (Icefjord) previously inferred to express ongoing gas release from decomposing gas hydrate show no evidence of gas seepage, and are more likely a result of neo-tectonism.",

		"abstract": "A hitherto unrecognized Paleogene outcrop has been discovered at Sylfjellet, a mountain located at the northern side of Isfjorden, Svalbard. The strata, which cover an area of 0.8 km2, have until now been assigned to the Lower Cretaceous succession of the Adventdalen Group. In this study, the Sylfjellet site was studied in detail to provide an updated structural and sedimentological description of strata and lithostratigraphy. The age and burial history of the investigated succession were constrained by absolute (U/PB) and relative dating methods in addition to vitrinite reflectance analyses of coal seams. The results show a Paleogene age of the deposits, which is supported by the occurrence of an angiosperm pollen grain, plant macrofossils, and a tephra layer of early Selandian age (61.53 Ma). The 250 m-thick succession of Sylfjellet is assigned to the Firkanten, Basilika and Grumantbyen formations. This succession unconformably overlies the Lower Cretaceous Helvetiafjellet Formation. Sylfjellet is incorporated into the West Spitsbergen Fold-and-Thrust Belt and interpreted to be a fourth structural outlier of the Van Mijenfjorden Group. Vitrinite reflectance data indicate that at least 2000 m overburden has been eroded above the Sylfjellet coal seams, and that maximum burial of the strata predates folding and thrusting in the area.",

		"abstract": "Recent discoveries of hydrocarbons along the western margin of the Norwegian Barents Shelf have emphasised the need for a better understanding of the source rock potential of the Upper Palaeozoic succession. In this study, a comprehensive set of organic geochemical data have been collected from the Carboniferous – Permian interval outcropping on Svalbard in order to re-assess the offshore potential. Four stratigraphic levels with organic-rich facies have been identified: (i) Lower Carboniferous (Mississippian) fluvio-lacustrine intervals with TOC between 1 and 75 wt.% and a cumulative organic-rich section more than 100 m thick; (ii) Upper Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) evaporite-associated marine shales and organic-rich carbonates with TOC up to 20 wt.%; (iii) a widespread lowermost Permian organic-rich carbonate unit, 2–10 m thick, with 1–10 wt. % TOC; and (iv) Lower Permian organic-rich marine shales with an average TOC content of 10 wt.%. Petroleum can potentially be tied to organic-rich facies at formation level based on the gammacerane index, δ13C of the aromatic fraction and/or the Pr/Ph ratio. Relatively heavy δ13C values, a low gammacerane index and high Pr/Ph ratios characterize Lower Carboniferous non-marine sediments, whereas evaporite-associated facies have lighter δ13C, a higher gammacerane index and lower Pr/Ph ratios.",

Net erosion values vary from 0 to more than 3000 m. The processes have important consequences for the petroleum systems. Reservoir quality, maturity of the source rocks and the migration of hydrocarbons are affected by the processes. Owing to changes in the PVT conditions in a hydrocarbon-filled structure, uplift and erosion increase the risk of leakage and expansion of the gas cap in a structure. Understanding of the timing of uplift and re-migration of hydrocarbons has been increasingly important in the exploration of the Barents Sea.",

		"abstract": "Skip to Next Section\nSwath bathymetry data and one sediment core were used to improve the understanding of the Late Weichselian and Holocene glacier activity in Billefjorden, Svalbard. Grounded ice existed in Billefjorden prior to 11.23 cal ka BP (calendar years before present), depositing a basal till and producing glacial lineations. The glacier front retreated from the central parts to the inner parts of the fjord between c. 11.23 and 11.2 cal ka BP. Annual recessional moraines suggest that this retreat occurred at a rate of up to 170 m a−1. During the early Holocene, the glacier Nordenskiöldbreen was comparatively small and sediment supply to central Billefjorden occurred mainly from the fjord sides. An increase in ice rafting around 7930 cal a BP is ascribed to enhanced sea-ice formation. The activity of Nordenskiöldbreen increased around 5470 cal a BP. Ice rafting was generally low during the past c. 3230 a. This was most likely related to the formation of a more permanent sea-ice cover. Nordenskiöldbreen reached its maximum Holocene extent around AD 1900, generating glacial lineations and depositing a terminal moraine in the inner fjord. Annual recessional moraines were formed during its subsequent retreat. Icebergs from Nordenskiöldbreen generated iceberg ploughmarks during the late Holocene.",

These landforms are essentially unmodified since their initial deposition over the past hundred years or so because they have not been subjected to subaerial erosion or periglacial activity. Swath images comprise an assemblage of superimposed landforms, allowing reconstruction of relative age of deposition: (1) large transverse ridges, interpreted as recessional moraines overridden by a subsequent ice advance; (2) a series of curvilinear streamlined bedforms orientated parallel to former ice flow, interpreted as lineations formed subglacially during rapid advance; (3) large terminal ridges, marking the farthest extent of ice at the last advance, with flow lobes immediately beyond interpreted as submarine debris flows; (4) a series of interconnected rhombohedral ridges, interpreted as a product of soft sediment squeezing into crevasses formed at the glacier bed, probably formed during immediate post-surge stagnation; and (5) a series of fairly evenly spaced small transverse ridges, interpreted as push moraines produced annually at tidewater glacier termini during retreat. A simple descriptive landsystem model for tidewater glaciers of probable surge type is derived from these observations. We also show that megascale glacial lineations can form not only beneath large ice streams, but are also produced beneath surging tidewater glaciers lying on deforming sedimentary beds.",

		"abstract": "One of the few long instrumental records available for the Arctic is the Svalbard Airport composite series that hitherto began in 1911, with observations made on Spitsbergen, the largest island in the Svalbard Archipelago. This record has now been extended to 1898 with the inclusion of observations made by hunting and scientific expeditions. Temperature has been observed almost continuously in Svalbard since 1898, although at different sites. It has therefore been possible to create one composite series for Svalbard Airport covering the period 1898–2012, and this valuable new record is presented here. The series reveals large temperature variability on Spitsbergen, with the early 20th century warming as one striking feature: an abrupt change from the cold 1910s to the local maxima of the 1930s and 1950s. With the inclusion of the new data it is possible to show that the 1910s were colder than the years at the start of the series. From the 1960s, temperatures have increased, so the present temperature level is significantly higher than at any earlier period in the instrumental history. For the entire period, and for all seasons, there are positive, statistically significant trends. Regarding the annual mean, the total trend is 2.6°C/century, whereas the largest trend is in spring, at 3.9°C/century. In Europe, it is the Svalbard Archipelago that has experienced the greatest temperature increase during the latest three decades. The composite series may be downloaded from the home page of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and should be used with reference to the present article.",

		"abstract": "The recently observed warming of west Spitsbergen fjords has led to anomalous sea-ice conditions and has implications for the marine ecosystem. We investigated long-term trends of maximum temperature of Atlantic Water (AW) in two west Spitsbergen fjords. The data set is composed of more than 400 oceanographic stations for Isfjorden and Grønfjorden (78.1°N), spanning from 1876 to 2009. Trends throughout the last century (1912–2009) indicate an increase of 1.9°C and 2.1°C in the maximum temperature during autumn for Isfjorden and Grønfjorden, respectively. A recent warming event in the beginning of the 21st century is found to be more than 1°C higher than the second warmest period in the time series. Mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) data from ERA-40 and ERA-Interim data sets produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and mean temperature in the core of the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) at the Sørkapp Section along 76.3°N were used to explain the variability of the maximum temperature. A correlation analysis confirmed previous findings, showing that variability in the oceanography of the fjords can be explained mainly by two external factors: AW temperature variability in the WSC and regional patterns of the wind stress field. To take both processes into consideration, a multiple regression model accounting for temperature in the WSC core and MSLP over the area was developed. The predicted time series shows a reasonable agreement with observed maxima temperature in Isfjorden for the period 1977–2009 (N=24), with a statistically significant multiple correlation coefficient of 0.60 (R 2=0.36) at P<0.05.",

		"abstract": "Progressing warming in the Arctic and increased extreme weather events can significantly influence the hydrography of Svalbard fjords, leading to changes towards more Atlantic-type waters in the fjords. In this paper, we look into the hydrographic conditions in Hornsund, the southernmost fjord on the west coast of Svalbard, by analysing high-resolution CTD measurements collected in July during cruises with the RV Oceania between 2001 and 2015. These observations revealed high interannual variability in temperature, salinity and distribution of water masses, mainly due to differences in timing of the transition between winter and summer conditions but also as a result of changing environmental factors such as air temperature and sea-ice cover. Hornsund shows weak Atlantic Water occupation, probably due to strong influence of the Sørkapp Current along the southern coast of Spitsbergen. The main basin of the fjord was much more influenced by waters entering the fjord from outside than the inner basin, Brepollen, which was mainly characterized by the presence of locally formed Winter Cooled Water (WCW). The amount and properties of WCW in Brepollen revealed high variability after 2006, and no WCW in July 2012. The results of our study show that Hornsund is highly variable and susceptible to recently observed atmospheric and oceanic extreme events in the Svalbard region.",

In this work, the possibility of using vapour (or partial) pressure of aqueous solutions for estimating the hydrate stability zone has been investigated. Following that, a new correlation has been developed for estimating the hydrate stability zone of various fluid systems in the presence of salts and/or organic inhibitors. The correlation is based on the assumption that the changes in the water properties due to the presence of salts and/or organic inhibitors play the main role on the hydrate characteristics of aqueous systems. The developed correlation relates the hydrate inhibition characteristics of aqueous systems to the changes in the water partial pressure due to the presence of salts and/or organic inhibitors. It takes into account the effect of hydrocarbon phase and/or hydrate structure by introducing the hydrate dissociation pressure at a given temperature in the presence of distilled water. The correlation has been developed using the predicted hydrate phase boundaries for 10 fluid systems generated by a well-proven comprehensive thermodynamic model. The correlation has been used for predicting the hydrate stability zones for 19 independent fluid systems. The results are compared with the available experimental data, demonstrating the reliability of the newly developed correlation.",

		"abstract": "Skip to Next Section\nFjords have long been recognized for their value as sites of sediment deposition, recording past climatic conditions. Recently, Arctic fjords have been recognized as the critical gateway through which oceanic waters can impact on the stability of glaciers. Arctic fjords are also used as idealized locations to study ice-influenced physical, biological and geochemical processes. In all cases a clear understanding of the physical oceanographic environment is required to interpret and predict related impacts and linkages. In this review we consider the characteristic elements of Arctic fjords and the important dynamical processes. We show how the intense seasonality of these regions is reflected in the varying stratification of the fjords. In particular, we show that sea ice has a central role in terms of the fjord salinity which ultimately influences the exchange with oceanic waters. When the fjord is ice free, wind forcing from the intense down-fjord katabatic winds gives rise to rapidly changing cross-fjord gradients, upwelling and strong surface circulations. The stratification and dimensions of Arctic fjords mean that they are often classed as ‘broad’ fjords where rotational effects are important in their circulation. We refer to the link between the physical oceanographic conditions and the related depositional records throughout.",

		"abstract": "The Kongsfjorden conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) Transect has been monitored annually since 1994. It covers the full length of the fjord and the shelf, and the upper part of the shelf slope outside Kongsfjorden. In addition to CTD profiles, data from vessel-mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and moorings have been collected. Previous studies noted that Atlantic Water (AW) from the West Spitsbergen Current was observed in the fjord every summer, but to a varying extent. The prolonged monitoring provided by the Kongsfjorden Transect data set examined here reveals continuous variations in AW content and vertical distribution in the fjord, both on seasonal and inter-annual timescales. Our focus in this paper is on this variable content of AW in Kongsfjorden, the forcing mechanisms that may govern the inflow of this water mass, and its distribution in the fjord. We classify three winter types linked to three characteristic scenarios for winter formation of water masses. During the historically typical winters of type “Winter Deep”, deep convection, often combined with sea ice formation, produces dense winter water that prevents AW from entering Kongsfjorden. Summer inflow of AW starts when density differences between fjord and shelf water allows for it, and occurs at some intermediate depth. During winters of type “Winter Intermediate”, AW advects into the fjord along the bottom via Kongsfjordrenna. Winter convection in Kongsfjorden will then be limited to intermediate depth, usually producing very cold intermediate water. Deep AW inflow continues during the following summer. A winter of type “Winter Open” seems to develop when open water convection produces very dense shelf water, and AW winter advection into Kongsfjorden occurs at the surface. Summer AW inflow is rather shallow after such winters. We find that variations between Winter Deep and Winter Intermediate winters are due to inherent natural variability. However, the Winter Open winters seem to be a consequence of the general trend of atmospheric and oceanic warming, and, more specifically, of the decreasing sea ice cover in the Arctic region. The Winter Open winters have all occurred after an unusual flooding of AW onto the West Spitsbergen shelf in February 2006.",

		"abstract": "The Longyearbyen CO2 Lab of Svalbard, Norway was established to estimate the potential for geological carbon sequestration at Spitsbergen. Several monitoring wells were drilled in and around the planned CO2 injection site. These revealed a Triassic to Cretaceous stratigraphy consisting of (from top to bottom) a zone of permafrost, the aquifer, the caprock shale, and the upper, middle and lower reservoir. This paper uses two tools to investigate fluid communication within and between these entities: 87Sr/86Sr of formation waters extracted from cores using the residual salt analysis (RSA) method, and the δ13C of gases, principally methane and CO2, degassed from core samples. The Sr RSA data reveal that the upper reservoir rocks have very constant formation water 87Sr/86Sr (0.7130) in wells several kilometres apart, suggesting good lateral communication on a geological timescale. However, there is a distinct barrier to vertical communication within the middle reservoir, indicated by a step change in 87Sr/86Sr (0.7130–0.7112), corresponding to thin but presumably laterally extensive (>1.5km) lagoonal mudrocks. The aquifer, which shows a gradient in 87Sr/86Sr, is also interpreted to have some degree of vertical internal communication on a geological time scale. The caprock shale shows large-scale (over 350m) smooth vertical gradient in 87Sr/86Sr (0.7200-0.7130). This is indicative of an ongoing mixing process between high- 87Sr/86Sr waters within the caprock and lower- 87Sr/86Sr waters in the underlying reservoir. Diffusion and flow modelling of the Sr data suggest that at some time in the past, shale fluid transport properties were enhanced by the formation of temporary pressure escape features (fractures or chimneys) during deep burial and uplift, or cycles of glaciation. Nevertheless, the smooth compositional gradient in the caprock indicates that fluid mixing has subsequently taken place slowly, dominated by diffusion. This interpretation is supported by the gas isotope data, where systematic variations in gas δ13C (-50‰ to −32‰) values also indicate slow and incomplete diffusional fluid mixing. These are positive indicators for caprock effectiveness during a CO2 injection project.",

This is due to the effects of the Earth's rotation on stratified waters in wide fjords. Observations from a semi-enclosed fjord basin, Van Mijenfjorden on Spitsbergen, show that the hydrography and circulation vary considerably on short timescales (hours) in the summer season. The depth and distribution of the low salinity upper water layer respond quickly to changes in the wind field. The Coriolis effect has an essential impact on the circulation, inducing eddy-like flow patterns and strong cross-fjord gradients. Within the upper layer, the lowest salinity values and highest temperatures were found on the northern side of the fjord in calm wind periods. When the wind was strong from the west, the cross-fjord gradients were reversed. Internal wave activity contributes to large vertical displacement of water below the upper layer. Knowledge of such strongly variable hydrographic conditions in fjords are important for sampling strategy and interpretation of data, for instance of primary production and sedimentation processes, and for the understanding of fjords as depositional systems.",

		"abstract": "Manual classification of fast ice, pack ice, and polynya (open water and thin ice) in Storfjorden from ERS-2 SAR images during winters 1998 to 2001 was used to determine model parameters in a wind-driven polynya width model. Production of ice in the classified areas was then calculated from surface heat balance. The modeled open water area occupied on average 10% of the total area and produced 58% of the total ice (Tice). The volume of brine-enriched shelf water (BSW; Vbsw) was estimated to be in the range 0.9–1.1 × 1012 m3 or 0.06–0.07 Sv (freezing period average) and 0.03–0.04 Sv (annual average). The strength of the northerly wind component seemed to dominate over net heat flux as cause of variability in Tice. Salinity of BSW (Sbsw) was found to be primarily governed by frazil ice production, whereas Vbsw was mostly determined from Tice and surface salinity (initial and change during winter). Correlation studies of modeled time series of winter mean polynya area and Tice in winters 1970 to 2001 showed that interannual variability could partly be explained by variability in regional ice and ocean conditions, and partly by the strength of the southwesterlies from the North Atlantic or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Strong southerly winds (high NAO) may give less Arctic ice import and ice production in the western Barents Sea, resulting in a higher surface salinity in Storfjorden in fall. The resulting weak stability in the water column may give favorable conditions for producing large Vbsw the following winter. If strong northerly winds over Storfjorden are associated with low NAO, rapid transitions from high to low NAO would give high Vbsw and Sbsw. The link to NAO seems to vary in time. However, the transition from weak northerly winds in winter 1999 to strong northerly winds in winter 2000 was accompanied by high observed Sbsw winter 2000 in agreement with expectations.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, Svalbard fjords have experienced a substantial reduction in winter sea-ice extent. This has been linked to changes in wind stress patterns over Fram Strait and an increased transport of warm Atlantic Water into the fjords. In November 2014, we deployed two Slocum gliders to Isfjorden and measured the hydrographical properties and depth-averaged currents in the region. The campaign marked the first time gliders have been used inside an Arctic fjord. We observed geostrophically balanced flow patterns both in the mouth, where the heat flux into the fjord was calculated to be 0.13 TW, and in the interior of Isfjorden, where geostrophic flows were up to 20 cm s−1. After a change in the prevailing wind direction on the West Spitsbergen Shelf, we found evidence for a wind-driven geostrophic control mechanism at the fjord mouth, impeding fjord–shelf exchange, and found that the geostrophic circulation inside the fjord had broken down. We conclude that the circulation patterns in Isfjorden are heavily influenced by rotational effects and by wind activity both locally and on the West Spitsbergen Shelf, and that geostrophically balanced exchange flows may deliver Atlantic Water to the fjord interior given the correct conditions at the fjord mouth. The combination of hydrography and high-resolution velocity data from throughout the Isfjorden region provided new insights into the circulation here, suggesting that this approach will be useful for studying high-latitude fjords in the future.",

		"abstract": "Rates of ice mass loss at the calving margins of tidewater glaciers (frontal ablation rates) are a key uncertainty in sea level rise projections. Measurements are difficult because mass lost is replaced by ice flow at variable rates, and frontal ablation incorporates sub-aerial calving, and submarine melt and calving. Here we derive frontal ablation rates for three dynamically contrasting glaciers in Svalbard from an unusually dense series of satellite images. We combine ocean data, ice-front position and terminus velocity to investigate controls on frontal ablation. We find that frontal ablation is not dependent on ice dynamics, nor reduced by glacier surface freeze-up, but varies strongly with sub-surface water temperature. We conclude that calving proceeds by melt undercutting and ice-front collapse, a process that may dominate frontal ablation where submarine melt can outpace ice flow. Our findings illustrate the potential for deriving simple models of tidewater glacier response to oceanographic forcing.",

		"abstract": "In this article, the results of an investigation into the air temperature conditions on Svalbard in the period 1 September 2010 to 31 August 2011 are presented. For this period, parallel temperature measurements have been made as many as in 30 sites. On the basis of this unique set of data it was possible to study, in detail, the spatial distribution of different thermal characteristics [mean temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR), day-to-day variability, degree of climate continentality, etc.] in Svalbard. Such knowledge of the whole of Svalbard was not previously available with sufficient accuracy for all areas. High resolution maps showing the spatial distribution of all studied thermal characteristics were also produced and analysed. Analysis of surface temperature data shows that the markedly coldest area throughout the whole year was northern Svalbard, and in particular its eastern side (Nordaustlandet). On the other hand, the highest temperatures were recorded in western part of Spitsbergen. The greatest spatial decreasing rate of temperature in Svalbard throughout the whole year was observed in a southwest (SW)–northeast (NE) direction. The distribution of mean seasonal and annual temperature reduced to sea level on Svalbard differs from the distribution based on surface temperatures. Spring, and in particular winter, saw the greatest DTRs (4–7 and 6–9 °C, respectively), while the lowest were observed in summer (3.0–3.5 °C). In all seasons, the highest DTR were mainly noted in the NE part of Svalbard, while the lowest were in its SW part. The lowest continentality of climate (30%) is clearly seen in the south-western part of Svalbard, while the highest values (above 43%) stretch from the western part of Nordaustlandet to the area of Sveagruva in the central-eastern part of Spitsbergen. The NORA10 hindcast temperature data differ significantly from measured data for some seasons and areas and need bias corrections when used in climatology.",

		"abstract": "The growth and stability of the free-gas zone (FGZ) beneath gas-hydrate related bottom-simulating seismic reflectors (BSRs) is investigated using analytical and numerical analyses to understand the factors controlling the formation and depletion of free gas. For a model based on the continental slope west of Svalbard (a continental margin of north Atlantic type), we find that the FGZ is inherently unstable under a wide range of conditions because upward flow of under-saturated liquid depletes free gas faster than it is produced by hydrate recycling. In these scenarios, the 150-m-thick FGZ that presently exists there would deplete within 105–106 years. We suggest the FGZ is in a stable state, however, that is formed by a diffusion-dominated mechanism that produces low concentrations of gas in a FGZ of steady state thickness. Gas forms across a thick zone because the upward fluid flux is relatively low and because the gas–water solubility decreases to a minimum several hundred meters below the seabed. This newly understood solubility-curvature effect is complementary to hydrate recycling, but becomes the most important factor controlling the presence and properties of the BSR in environments where the rate of upward fluid flow and the rate of hydrate recycling are both relatively low (i.e., rifted continental margins). If the present-day FGZ is in steady state, we estimate that the upward fluid flux in the west Svalbard site must be less than 0.15 mm a−1.",

		"abstract": "Shallow gas hydrate deposits in the Arctic regions can undergo rapid \ndissociation as a result of rising temperatures and/or decreasing\npressure due to thawing permafrost seal releasing large amounts of\nmethane into the water column and to the atmosphere.  Svalbard is\nlocated within the zone of continuous permafrost. Periglacial and\npermafrost-related terrain features are widespread in areas not covered\nby glaciers. According to published data the thickness of permafrost at\nthe coast is about 10-40 m, increasing to more than 450 m in the\nhighlands.   High resolution swath bathymetry data were used to\nsystematically map the glacial landforms and pockmarks in the Isfjorden\nregion. The pockmarks comprise randomly distributed circular and\nelliptical depressions. Their diameters range from 30 m to 242 m and the\nmaximum depth is 11 m. Raised rims occur locally. Pockmark strings are\nlocated within glacial lineations formed during the Late Weichselian\nglaciation. The maximum water depth of the Isfjorden is 428 m and\nsea-bottom temperatures range from -2 to 5 °C. The extent and\nthickness of possible methane hydrate in Isfjorden has been calculated\nand the overlapping zones with potential pockmarks and glacial landforms\nin the fjord seafloor have been analysed in this study. Phase diagrams\nshow that the stability field of methane hydrate is dependent on\ntemperature, pressure and the composition of the hydrate-forming gas.\nThermo-baric modeling indicates that 280 m of water depth is required\nfor pure methane to potentially form a hydrate at 0 °C. The presence\nof NMHC (non-methane hydrocarbons: C1 to C5 alkanes) would require\nshallower water depths to form gas hydrates. Glacial ice cover would\nincrease the load to the sedimentary column, increasing pressure on the\nunderlying sediments. The temperature in the underlying sediments would\nalso be lower due to the base of the ice which is at around 0-2 °C\nthereby increasing the potential for formation of gas hydrates.  The\npreliminary mapping and modelling results suggest that, in addition to\nthe potential deep sources for the past seabed seeps, the distribution\nof pockmarks in Isfjorden could result partly from the dissociation of\ngas hydrates due to warming fjord waters. Another potential cause may be\nthe release of methane associated with the thawing permafrost in the\ncoastal areas.  Further exploration of gas hydrates and monitoring of\nmethane release are needed to quantify the likely magnitude of future\nemissions and their possible implications on the regional and global\nclimate.",

		"abstract": "New swath-bathymetric data from the inner parts of the three Svalbard fjords Ymerbukta, Trygghamna, and Magdalenefjorden reveal the landform assemblages deposited in front of tidewater glaciers in west and northwest Spitsbergen. Overridden moraines in Ymerbukta, a tributary of Isfjorden in central west Spitsbergen, record several re-advances of the Esmarkbreen glacier at the head of the fjord after deglaciation, and glacial lineations formed in seafloor sediments are indicative of fast ice advance during one of these events. A terminal moraine and associated debris lobe mark the maximum ice extent during the Holocene, which, implied by the presence of crevasse-squeeze ridges, is likely related to a surge of Esmarkbreen. Several De Geer moraines provide evidence for subsequent slow and step-wise retreat. In the adjacent Trygghamna and in Magdalenefjorden in northwest Spitsbergen the landforms are similar but the absence of overridden moraines and glacial lineations shows that the glaciers probably only re-advanced once during the Holocene and that ice flow was relatively slow. Terminal moraines and associated debris lobes mark the maximum extent of these advances and formed during the Little Ice Age (LIA). In Magdalenefjorden the relatively small size of the debris lobe suggests that the ice margin was at its maximum position for only a short period of time, or that sediment availability was restricted during the LIA advance. Similar to Esmarkbreen the retreat phase of the glaciers in Trygghamna and Magdalenefjorden was also characterised by periods of still-stand or small re-advances, although the comparatively small number of De Geer moraines in all three fjords shows that these landforms probably formed much less frequently than previously thought. Sub-bottom profiler data, four sediment cores and six radiocarbon dates from Magdalenefjorden further provide information about the Holocene sedimentary environments in a northwest Spitsbergen fjord. The main source of sediment is glacial meltwater entering the fjord from the surrounding coastline, which has led to the accumulation of thick sequences of fine-grained mud. Stratified and laminated muds record glacier-proximal conditions, probably related to a LIA re-advance of Waggonwaybreen around 300calaBP, where the interplay of a range of glacimarine processes led to the formation of partially rhythmic couplets of one coarser and one finer layer, accumulated at a rate of around 3cma−1. Multiple sandy layers intercalated with the glacimarine mud provide evidence for the occurrence of gravitational mass-flow events like turbidity currents. In ice-distal settings, massive to weakly stratified, occasionally bioturbated mud accumulated at a lower rate of 0.04–0.49cma−1. Occasional clasts and diamictic layers show that the depositional environment in Magdalenefjorden is also influenced by sedimentation from icebergs and sea ice, but the ubiquitous glacimarine mud underscores the predominance of meltwater-related sedimentation in the fjord.",

		"abstract": "The last glacial maximum (LGM) and post-glacial Quaternary history of Forlandsundet, the strait between western Spitsbergen and Prins Karls Forland, are enigmatic. Previous terrestrial field studies report contradicting evidence for an ice sheet either overriding the entire strait or completely absent during the LGM. Here, we present a multi-proxy investigation of marine sediments, high-resolution bathymetric data and aerial imagery from Forlandsundet. We reveal glacial till present at 15 cal. ka BP and geomorphological landforms characteristic to an inter-ice-stream glaciated margin. This new evidence implies that the Forlandsundet region was fully glaciated during the LGM. This glaciation was followed by a stepwise retreat of glacial ice during the Bølling–Allerød (14.7–12.7 cal. ka BP) and Younger Dryas (12.7–11.7 cal. ka BP). The Holocene record from the marine sediments is incomplete, with a hiatus from approximately 11.8 to 7.4 cal. ka BP, interpreted as an erosive event. By the mid-Holocene (7.4 cal. ka BP), more temperate, Atlantic conditions based on the benthic foraminiferal assemblages prevailed, and are followed by gradual cooling into the late Holocene (< 4 cal. ka BP). This study provides new data to resolve the LGM extent of the Svalbard–Barents Sea ice sheet in the Forlandsundet region and sheds light on the deglacial ice dynamics in a palaeo-inter-ice-stream area driven by the inflow of warm Atlantic water.",

		"abstract": "Between the fjords Dicksonfjorden and Billefjorden in central Spitsbergen, Svalbard's youngest deposits (Early Givetian to Famennian in age) of the Old Red Sandstone—the Mimerdalen Subgroup—are exposed. They form a narrow outcrop area parallel to the Billefjorden Fault Zone and overlie unconformably the multicoloured sandstones of the Lower Devonian Wood Bay Formation. Stratigraphic rank and subdivision of the succession were changed repeatedly since its first mention in 1910. Based on student work in 1996, as well as regional mapping by the authors in 1993 and 2003, the present work formalizes the stratigraphic framework of the succession. This framework has already been applied in recent geological maps. At the same time it is a continuation of the lithostratigraphic standardization carried out by the Committee on the Stratigraphy of Svalbard (1999), where only post-Devonian rocks were considered. Except for some small-pebble conglomerate layers in the Wood Bay Formation, the upper part of the Mimerdalen Subgroup contains the first coarse-grained deposits in Svalbard's Old Red since the lowermost Devonian Red Bay Group. Faulting between its formations as well as conglomerate pebbles derived from the Lower Devonian Wood Bay Formation indicate the onset of the Svalbardian Event after the tectonic stability during the deposition of the Wood Bay Formation. The Mimerdalen Subgroup is probably the detrital fill of a small foreland basin derived from erosion during the uplift of the Ny-Friesland Block to the east of the Billefjorden Fault Zone. It was later affected by compressional tectonic movements during the Svalbardian Event.",

The discovery in 2008 of over 250 plumes of methane gas escaping from the seabed of the West Svalbard continental margin at 400 m water depth (mwd) suggests that hydrate is dissociating in the present-day Arctic. Here we model the dynamic response of hydrate-bearing sediments over a period of 2300 years and investigate ocean warming as a possible cause for present-day and likely future dissociation of hydrate, within 350–800 mwd, west of Svalbard. Future temperatures are given by two climate models, HadGEM2 and CCSM4, and scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5 and 2.6.

(p. 284, published online 2 January) present a record of methane seepage from marine sediments off the coast of Svalbard showing that such emissions have been present for at least 3000 years, the result of normal seasonal fluctuations of bottom waters. Thus, contemporary observations of strong methane venting do not necessarily mean that the clathrates that are the source of the methane are decomposing at a faster rate than in the past.\nMethane hydrate is an icelike substance that is stable at high pressure and low temperature in continental margin sediments. Since the discovery of a large number of gas flares at the landward termination of the gas hydrate stability zone off Svalbard, there has been concern that warming bottom waters have started to dissociate large amounts of gas hydrate and that the resulting methane release may possibly accelerate global warming. Here, we corroborate that hydrates play a role in the observed seepage of gas, but we present evidence that seepage off Svalbard has been ongoing for at least 3000 years and that seasonal fluctuations of 1° to 2°C in the bottom-water temperature cause periodic gas hydrate formation and dissociation, which focus seepage at the observed sites.\nSeasonal gas hydrate destabilization has been releasing methane from marine sediments near Svalbard for at least 3000 years.\nSeasonal gas hydrate destabilization has been releasing methane from marine sediments near Svalbard for at least 3000 years.",

		"abstract": "The evolution of the northwestern Barents Sea continental margin, part of a NW-SE trending mega shear zone, has been reconstructed in order to quantify the sedimentation and erosion affecting this area during and after its formation in the Paleogene–Neogene. This development was closely related to the sea-floor opening of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. Our study incorporated 2D seismic data, well data, and information from shallow cores. During the Paleocene–Eocene, the northwesternmost Barents Sea margin was subjected to compression-transpression that led to the development of the West Spitsbergen Fold-Thrust Belt (WSFTB) and largely affected the northern part of the study area. To the south, the Vestbakken volcanic province developed in a pull-apart setting. A transition zone separates these two areas marked by a basin morphology becoming more pronounced to the south suggesting increasing subsidence and extension. Subsequently, during the Oligocene, extension and sea-floor spreading were initiated along the whole margin, resulting in the opening of the Fram Strait between Spitsbergen and NE Greenland in the Miocene. During the Paleocene, the Stappen High and a part of the NE Greenland shelf sourced sediments into the newly developing basins. The southwestern part of the WSFTB, the Stappen High, and part of the NE Greenland margin are interpreted as the main sediment source areas in the Eocene. During the Oligocene and Neogene, a larger part of the northwestern Barents Sea shelf is interpreted to have acted as source area including the Edgeøya platform. As a result of this development, the wider Barents Sea shelf itself is inferred to have been a lowland prior to the northern hemisphere glaciations. We found that the average sedimentation rate for the Paleogene–Neogene at the northwestern Barents Sea margin is about 0.034 m/k.y. This number is in agreement with the sedimentation rate reported from present-day fluvial systems and modern rates coastal erosion. By using a mass-balance approach, we have also estimated the average net erosion and erosion rate for the Paleogene–Neogene period to be ∼2440 m and 0.038 m/k.y, respectively. This erosion rate is two times higher compared to the southwestern Barents Sea margin, probably reflecting erosion of a more tectonically active northwestern margin. Thus, for the western Barents Sea margin, a general increasing trend of pre-glacial erosion northwards can be inferred. This study also suggests that more than half of the Cenozoic erosion affecting the studied part of the northwestern Barents Sea were of pre-glacial origin.",

		"abstract": "The creation of the huge fans observed in the western Barents Sea margin can only be explained by assuming extremely high glacial erosion rates in the Barents Sea area. Glacial processes capable of producing such high erosion rates have been proposed, but require the largest part of the preglacial Barents Sea to be subaerial. To investigate the validity of these proposals we have attempted to reconstruct the western preglacial Barents Sea. Our approach was to combine erosion maps based on prepublished data into a single mean valued erosion map covering the whole western Barents Sea and consequently use it together with a simple Airy isostatic model to obtain a first rough estimate of the preglacial topography and bathymetry of the western Barents Sea margin. The mean valued erosion map presented herein is in good volumetric agreement with the sediments deposited in the western Barents Sea margin areas, and as a direct consequence of the averaging procedures employed in its construction we can safely assume that it is the most reliable erosion map based on the available information. By comparing the preglacial sequences with the glacial sequences in the fans we have concluded that 1/2 to 2/3 of the total Cenozoic erosion was glacial in origin and therefore a rough reconstruction of the preglacial relief of the western Barents Sea could be obtained. The results show a subaerial preglacial Barents Sea. Thus, during interglacials and interstadials the area may have been partly glaciated and intensively eroded up to 1 mm/y, while during relatively brief periods of peak glaciation with grounded ice extending to the shelf edge, sediments have been evacuated and deposited at the margins at high rates. The interplay between erosion and uplift represents a typical chicken and egg problem; initial uplift is followed by intensive glacial erosion, compensated by isostatic uplift, which in turn leads to the maintenance of an elevated, and glaciated, terrain. The information we have on the initial tectonic uplift suggests that the most likely mechanism to cause an uplift of the dimensions and magnitude of the one observed in the Barents Sea is a thermal mechanism.",

Two main igneous centres have been proposed: (1) Central Spitsbergen and (2) the eastern Svalbard dolerite belt, spanning Hinlopenstretet and the islands of Edgeøya and Barentsøya. Offshore seismic and magnetic data suggest a link between the Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land igneous exposures. Intrusions occur predominantly as sills, up to 100m thick and laterally continuous for up to 30km. Dykes are present locally, and range in thickness from <10m up to 100m. A compilation of published geochemical data reveals that the vast majority of samples have a basaltic geochemical signature. Comparison to HALIP rocks elsewhere in the Arctic, including paleotectonic reconstructions, suggests that the Diabasodden Suite formed as part of an intra-plate basaltic complex originating from a source near the Alpha Ridge. Apart from Late Mesozoic magmatism, Svalbard has also experienced magmatic activity both before and after the intrusion of the Diabasodden Suite dolerites. These are distinguished on the basis of their geochemical signature and timing. Timing of the Diabasodden Suite magmatism is currently poorly constrained. More than 130 radiometric (Ar–Ar and K–Ar) ages have been published, with a wide range of ages (ca. 75–145Ma). Modern radiometric dating (U–Pb) on three samples suggests a shorter-lived intrusion pulse at ca. 124.5Ma (i.e. early Aptian). While much work has been conducted on the Diabasodden Suite in the past, a detailed synthesis of this widespread unit is presently missing. In this contribution we discuss the current knowledge on the Diabasodden Suite, synthesizing and reviewing the past studies as well as pointing out possible future research directions.",

		"abstract": "Marine gas hydrates, prevalent in offshore sediments in Canada and Japan, are a possible hydrocarbon resource, a hazard to drilling and a source of a major greenhouse gas. Quantitative estimates of hydrate concentrations in deep sea sediment are difficult to obtain by conventional methods. We have sought novel techniques specifically designed for assessment such as transient electric dipole-dipole electromagnetics. The latter method is based on the assumption of a reduced electrical conductivity in hydrate rich zones. Field trails of new apparatus on the Cascadia margin have proven successful. Excellent data were collected and analysed using a differential phase method to reduce systematic error. Apparent resistivities collected on three lines demonstrate that the resistivity of the seafloor is remarkably uniform over the whole survey area. The average hydrate concentration, deduced with the aid of a reference model based on the electrical logs of ODP holes 888 and 889, is about 17–26% of pore space (9–13% of sediment volume) in the 100 m interval above the BSR. The values are consistent with those obtained by other analyses. Further, the presence of hydrate is predicted in a region to the east of 889B where there is no visible BSR.",

This review concentrates on the western province, with its complex mosaic of basins and platforms. A growing net of coverage by seismic data, almost 70 deep hydrocarbon exploration wells and a series of shallow coring programmes, have contributed greatly to our understanding of this province, supplementing information from neighbouring land areas. The late Paleozoic to present-day development of the region can be described in terms of five major depositional phases. These partly reflect the continuing northwards movement of this segment of the Eurasian plate from the equatorial zone in the mid-Devonian–early Carboniferous up to its present-day High Arctic latitudes, resulting in significant climatic changes through time. Important controls on sedimentation have involved varying tectonic processes along the eastern, northern and western margins of the shelf, whereas short- and long-term local and regional sea-level variations have further determined the depositional history of the province.",

		"abstract": "The Lower Cretaceous succession in Svalbard is commonly considered as an important analogue to age-equivalent strata on the Barents Shelf which are sporadically targeted by exploration wells. In this study, the stratigraphic and genetic relationship between the Rurikfjellet (open marine), Helvetiafjellet (paralic) and Carolinefjellet (open marine) formations of the Lower Cretaceous succession in Svalbard is evaluated by combining sedimentological outcrop studies with well log and core data across Nordenskiöld Land, central Spitsbergen. Sedimentological characteristics and stratigraphic units are mapped within a refined dinocyst biostratigraphic framework, enabling relatively well-constrained palaeogeographic reconstructions. The Valanginian–lowermost Barremian Rurikfjellet Formation consists of a lower shale-dominated unit of offshore origin which grades upwards into storm-reworked lower shoreface sandstones displaying hummocky cross-stratification. Local occurrences of prodeltaic successions and thick successions of gravity flow deposits containing coal-bearing slump blocks of delta plain origin in some wells, reveal a late Hauterivian progradational pulse which has previously not been recorded in Svalbard. The lower Barremian– lower Aptian Helvetiafjellet Formation consists of fluvial braidplain and paralic deposits which rest unconformably on the Rurikfjellet Formation across the entire study area, reflecting regional uplift and widespread subaerial exposure prior to the onset of paralic deposition. The Helvetiafjellet Formation exhibits increased marine influence upwards, and in the investigated cores the uppermost part of the unit consists of wave-reworked mouth-bar deposits which are truncated by a transgressive conglomerate lag dominated by extrabasinal lithic clasts and intraformational siderite clasts. An up to 10 m-thick, regionally extensive, organic-rich (TOC up to 2.1 wt.%) shale unit of early Aptian age marks the base of the overlying Carolinefjellet Formation. The shale accumulated during a regional flooding event which drowned and eventually transformed the Helvetiafjellet Formation coastal plain into a shallow shelf. The organic facies of the shale unit (Type II–III kerogen) and a high Pr/Ph ratio (>2), in combination with abundant long-chained n-alkanes, suggest that the unit was deposited in a suboxic paralic marine environment strongly influenced by input of terrestrial organic matter. The investigated succession exhibits stratigraphic and petrographic resemblance to age-equivalent strata in NE Greenland, suggesting that these successions may have formed part of the same drainage system located on the northwestern margin of the Barents Shelf. Thus, by highlighting the Early Cretaceous palaeogeographic evolution in Svalbard, this study contributes to the regional stratigraphic understanding of the Lower Cretaceous succession on the wider northern Barents Shelf",

		"abstract": "The formation of gas hydrates in marine sediments changes their physical properties and hence influences fluid flow. Here, we review seismic indicators of gas hydrates and relate these indicators to gas hydrate formation and fluid migration. Analyses of seismic data from sediments containing gas and gas hydrates in a variety of locations have shown that the characteristic bottom-simulating reflector (BSR), which commonly marks the hydrate phase boundary is caused mainly by the presence of gas beneath the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). The amplitude of the BSR is also dependent on the hydrate concentration and on the porosity of the sediment. The presence of gas hydrate alters the elastic properties of sediments, particularly if it cements sediment grains. However, multifrequency studies in various geological provinces show that any loss of reflectivity or blanking observed within the GHSZ is dependent on both the nature of the sediments and concentration of hydrate present. Gas beneath the BSR may cause amplitude anomalies and may result in bright spots and enhanced reflections. The presence of gas beneath the BSR is the primary cause of observed amplitude versus offset (AVO) anomalies, but the amplitude of these anomalies is also dependent on the amount of cementation brought by the gas hydrates within the GHSZ. Fluid migration appears to play an important role in the formation and dissociation of gas hydrates in both active and passive margin settings. Fluid migration in accretionary prisms influences hydrate accumulation and may therefore control the spatial distribution of BSRs. Fluid migration may influence also the type of hydrate formed by bringing thermogenic gas containing higher order hydrocarbons to the GHSZ from below. Fluid advection may cause local dissociation of gas hydrates by bringing heat from below, thus shifting the gas hydrate phase boundary. Fluid flow within the GHSZ is limited by the formation of hydrate in the pore space, which reduces the permeability of the sediment. Features such as pockmarks, acoustic masking and acoustic turbidity are indirect indicators of fluid flow and identification of these features in seismic sections within and beneath the GHSZ may also suggest the formation of gas hydrate.",

		"abstract": "AbstractThe Holocene marine transgression starting at 19 ka flooded the Arctic shelves driving extensive thawing of terrestrial permafrost. It thereby promoted methanogenesis within sediments, the dissociation of gas hydrates, and the release of formerly trapped gas, with the accumulation in pressure of released methane eventually triggering blowouts through weakened zones in the overlying and thinned permafrost. Here we present a range of geophysical and chemical scenarios for the formation of pingo-like formations (PLFs) leading to potential blowouts. Specifically, we report on methane anomalies from the South Kara Sea shelf focusing on two PLFs imaged from high-resolution seismic records. A variety of geochemical methods are applied to study concentrations and types of gas, its character, and genesis. PLF 1 demonstrates ubiquitously low-methane concentrations (14.2–55.3 ppm) that are likely due to partly unfrozen sediments with an ice-saturated internal core reaching close to the seafloor. In contrast, PLF 2 reveals anomalously high-methane concentrations of >120,000 ppm where frozen sediments are completely absent. The methane in all recovered samples is of microbial and not of thermogenic origin from deep hydrocarbon sources. However, the relatively low organic matter content (0.52–1.69%) of seafloor sediments restricts extensive in situ methane production. As a consequence, we hypothesize that the high-methane concentrations at PLF 2 are due to microbial methane production and migration from a deeper source.",

		"abstract": "Isfjorden, a broad Arctic fjord in western Spitsbergen, has shown significant changes in hydrography and inflow of Atlantic Water (AW) the last decades that only recently have been observed in the Arctic Ocean north of Svalbard. Variability and trends in this fjord’s climate and circulation are therefore analysed from observational and reanalysis data during 1987 to 2017. Isfjorden experienced a shift in summer ocean structure in 2006, from AW generally in the bottom layer to AW (with increasing thickness) higher up in the water column. This shift, and a concomitant shift to less fast ice in Isfjorden are linked to positive trends in the mean sea surface temperature (SST) and volume weighted mean temperature (VT) in winter (SSTw/VTw: 0.7 ± 0.1/0.9 ± 0.3 °C 10yr-1) and summer (SSTS/VTS: 0.7 ± 0.1/0.6 ± 0.1°C 10yr-1). Hence, the local mean air temperature shows similar trends in winter (1.9 ± 0.4 °C 10yr-1) and summer (0.7 ± 0.1 °C 10yr-1). Positive trends in volume weighted mean salinity in winter (0.21 ± 0.06 10yr-1) and summer (0.07 ± 0.05 10yr-1) suggest increased AW advection as a main reason for Isfjorden’s climate change. Local mean air temperature correlates significantly with sea ice cover, SST, and VT, revealing the fjord’s impact on the local terrestrial climate. In line with the shift in summer ocean structure, Isfjorden has changed from an Arctic type fjord dominated by Winter Deep and Winter Intermediate thermal and haline convection, to a fjord dominated by deep thermal convection of Atlantic type water (Winter Open). AW indexes for the mouth and Isfjorden proper show that AW influence has been common in winter over the last decade. Alternating occurrence of Arctic and Atlantic type water at the mouth mirrors the geostrophic control imposed by the Spitsbergen Polar Current (carrying Arctic Water) relative to the strength of the Spitsbergen Trough Current (carrying AW). During high AW impact events, Atlantic type water propagates into the fjord according to the cyclonic circulation along isobaths corresponding to the winter convection. Tides play a minor role in the variance in the currents, but are important in the side fjords where exchange with the warmer Isfjorden proper occurs in winter. This study demonstrates that Isfjorden and its ocean climate can be used as an indicator for climate change in the Arctic Ocean. The used methods may constitute a set of helpful tools for future studies also outside the Svalbard Archipelago.",

		"abstract": "Owing to usual logistic hardships related to field-based cryospheric research, remote sensing has played a significant role in understanding the frozen components of the Earth system. Conventional spaceborne or airborne remote sensing platforms have their own merits and limitations. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a viable and inexpensive option for studying the cryospheric components at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions. UAVs are adaptable to various cryospheric research needs in terms of providing flexibility with data acquisition windows, revisits, data/sensor types (multispectral, hyperspectral, microwave, thermal/night imaging, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and photogrammetric stereos), viewing angles, flying altitudes, and overlap dimensions. Thus, UAVs have the potential to act as a bridging remote sensing platform between spatially discrete in situ observations and spatially continuous but coarser and costlier spaceborne or conventional airborne remote sensing. In recent years, a number of studies using UAVs for cryospheric research have been published. However, a holistic review discussing the methodological advancements, hardware and software improvements, results, and future prospects of such cryospheric studies is completely missing. In the present scenario of rapidly changing global and regional climate, studying cryospheric changes using UAVs is bound to gain further momentum and future studies will benefit from a balanced review on this topic. Our review covers the most recent applications of UAVs within glaciology, snow, permafrost, and polar research to support the continued development of high-resolution investigations of cryosphere. We also analyze the UAV and sensor hardware, and data acquisition and processing software in terms of popularity for cryospheric applications and revisit the existing UAV flying regulations in cold regions of the world. The recent usage of UAVs outlined in 103 case studies provide expertise that future investigators should base decisions on.",

Early applications of UAVs included cultural heritage and archaeology, mainly for the documentation and modelling of monuments, buildings and landscapes. In this paper, the focus is on the application of UAVs for documenting archaeological excavations. As excavating is a dynamic process and the objects to be acquired can change significantly within a few hours, UAVs can provide a suitable alternative to traditional measurement methods such as measuring tapes and tachymeters. Nevertheless, the image processing steps have to be automated, as a large number of resulting materials, usually sketches, maps, ortho-images and 3D models, need to be available quickly. In order to accelerate the processing workflow, an interface between the UAV ground control software and various photogrammetric software packages was developed at ETH Zurich, which allows for an efficient management and transfer of orientation, trajectory and sensor data for rapid project set up.",

		"abstract": "This study presents the operational framework for rapid, very-high resolution mapping of glacial geomorphology, with the use of budget Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and a structure-from-motion approach. The proposed workflow comprises seven stages: (1) Preparation and selection of the appropriate platform; (2) transport; (3) preliminary on-site activities (including optional ground-control-point collection); (4) pre-flight setup and checks; (5) conducting the mission; (6) data processing; and (7) mapping and change detection. The application of the proposed framework has been illustrated by a mapping case study on the glacial foreland of H&oslash;rbyebreen, Svalbard, Norway. A consumer-grade quadcopter (DJI Phantom) was used to collect the data, while images were processed using the structure-from-motion approach. The resultant orthomosaic (1.9 cm ground sampling distance&mdash;GSD) and digital elevation model (7.9 cm GSD) were used to map the glacial-related landforms in detail. It demonstrated the applicability of the proposed framework to map and potentially monitor detailed changes in a rapidly evolving proglacial environment, using a low-cost approach. Its coverage of multiple aspects ensures that the proposed framework is universal and can be applied in a broader range of settings.",

		"abstract": "Satellite remote sensing is an effective way to monitor vast extents of global glaciers and snowfields. However, satellite remote sensing is limited by spatial and temporal resolutions and the high costs involved in data acquisition. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based glaciological studies are gaining pace in recent years due to their advantages over conventional remote sensing platforms. UAVs are easy to deploy, with the option of alternating the sensors working in visible, infrared, and microwave wavelengths. The high spatial resolution remote sensing data obtained from these UAV-borne sensors are a significant improvement over the data obtained by traditional remote sensing. The cost involved in data acquisition is minimal and researchers can acquire imagery according to their schedule and convenience. We discuss significant glaciological studies involving UAV as remote sensing platforms. This is the first review work, exclusively dedicated to highlight UAV as a remote sensing platform in glaciology. We examine polar and alpine applications of UAV and their future prospects in separate sections and present an extensive reference list for the readers, so that they can delve into their topic of interest. Because the technology is still widely unexplored for snow and glaciers, we put a special emphasis on discussing the future prospects of utilising UAVs for glaciological research.",

		"abstract": "This contribution reviews the use of modern 3D photo-based surface reconstruction techniques for high fidelity surveys of trenches, rock exposures and hand specimens to highlight their potential for paleoseismology and structural geology. We outline the general approach to data acquisition and processing using ground-based photographs acquired from standard DSLR cameras, and illustrate the use of similar processing approaches on imagery from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). It is shown that digital map and trench data can be acquired at ultra-high resolution and in much shorter time intervals than would be normally achievable through conventional grid mapping. The resulting point clouds and textured models are inherently multidimensional (x, y, z, point orientation, colour, texture), archival and easily transformed into orthorectified photomosaics or digital elevation models (DEMs). We provide some examples for the use of such techniques in structural geology and paleoseismology while pointing the interested reader to free and commercial software packages for data processing, visualization and 3D interpretation. Photogrammetric models serve to act as an ideal electronic repository for critical outcrops and observations, similar to the electronic lab book approach employed in the biosciences. This paper also highlights future possibilities for rapid semi-automatic to automatic interpretation of the data and advances in technology.",

		"abstract": "Marine controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) data have been utilized in the past decade during petroleum exploration of the Barents Shelf, particularly for de-risking the highly porous sandstone reservoirs of the Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic Realgrunnen Subgroup. In this contribution we compare the resistivity response from CSEM data to resistivity from wireline logs in both water- and hydrocarbon-bearing wells. We show that there is a very good match between these types of data, particularly when reservoirs are shallow. CSEM data, however, only provide information on the subsurface resistivity. Careful, geology-driven interpretation of CSEM data is required to maximize the impact on exploration success. This is particularly important when quantifying the relative resistivity contribution of high-saturation hydrocarbon-bearing sandstone and that of the overlying cap rock. In the presented case the cap rock comprises predominantly organic rich Upper Jurassic–Early Cretaceous shales of the Hekkingen Formation (i.e. a regional source rock). The resistivity response of the reservoir and its cap rock become merged in CSEM data due to the transverse resistance equivalence principle. As a result of this, it is imperative to understand both the relative contributions from reservoir and cap rock, and the geological significance of any lateral resistivity variation in each of the units. In this contribution, we quantify the resistivity of organic rich mudstone, i.e. source rock, and reservoir sandstones, using 131 exploration boreholes from the Barents Shelf. The highest resistivity (>10,000 Ωm) is evident in the hydrocarbon-bearing Realgrunnen Subgroup which is reported from 48 boreholes, 41 of which are used for this study. Pay zone resistivity is primarily controlled by reservoir quality (i.e. porosity and shale fraction) and fluid phase (i.e. gas, oil and water saturation). In the investigated wells, the shale dominated Hekkingen Formation exhibits enhanced resistivity compared to the background (i.e. the underlying and overlying stratigraphy), though rarely exceeds 20 Ωm. Marine mudstones typically show good correlation between measured organic richness and resistivity/sonic velocity log signatures. We conclude that the resistivity contribution to the CSEM response from hydrocarbon-bearing sandstones outweighs that of the organic rich cap rocks.",

These reservoirs show a wide range of possible responses in seismic and well data, leading to high risk in exploration. Here, we present initital results from the use of an adapted version of the Xu-Payne carbonate rock physics model to analyse laboratory and well data of igneous reservoir rocks. We investigate the effect of various geological factors including mineralogy, alteration and fracturing on the porosity-velocity relation, and the potential of the rock physics model to use these trends for igneous reservoir characterization. Finally, we integrate the rock physics model with seismic forward modelling of an igneous sill complex to illustrate the relationship between reservoir properties and seismic response. Although calibration of the model should be more consistent for future case studies, we can successfully link the effect of changing mineralogy, alteration and pore space characteristics to the expected seismic velocity. We show that even for similar amount of porosity, the dominant pore shape (fractures vs rounded pores) can strongly alter the seismic image of an igneous reservoir target.",

Used in conjunction with rock physics, realistic geological models are obtained that are suitable as input to synthetic geophysics (e.g., seismic or electromagnetic modelling). Here we detail the workflow by implementing a case study from central Spitsbergen, Svalbard. The case study targets the seismic characteristics of various contact metamorphic aureole types associated with Early Cretaceous igneous intrusions. The bottom-up approach successfully integrates outcrops, wireline logging, and seismic data through use of well-derived rock physics relations, which is likely applicable and to the benefit of anything from carbonates to sandstone reservoirs. The extension of rock physics beyond borehole data is highly beneficial to geophysical interpretations as it allows for an improved quantification of uncertainties that is critical to proper basin and petroleum system analyses, especially in unconventional settings.",

		"abstract": "<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Methane release from beneath lowland permafrost represents an important uncertainty in the Arctic greenhouse gas budget. Our current knowledge is arguably best-developed in settings where permafrost is being inundated by rising sea level, which means much of the methane is oxidised in the water column before it reaches the atmosphere. Here we provide a different process perspective that is appropriate for Arctic fjord valleys, where local deglaciation causes isostatic uplift to out-pace rising sea level. We show how the uplift induces permafrost aggradation in former marine sediments, whose pressurisation results in methane escape directly to the atmosphere via ground water springs. In Adventdalen, Central Spitsbergen, we show how the springs are historic features, responsible for the formation of open system pingos, and capable of discharging brackish waters enriched with high concentrations of mostly biogenic methane (average 18&thinsp;mg&thinsp;L<sup>&minus;1</sup>). Thermodynamic calculations show that the methane concentrations sometimes marginally exceed the solubility limit for methane in water at 0&thinsp;&deg;C (41&thinsp;mg&thinsp;L<sup>&minus;1</sup>). In our case study, emissions from just four pingo springs with a combined discharge of less than 2&thinsp;L&thinsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup> increase the land-atmosphere methane flux by 16&thinsp;%. This confirms that sub-permafrost methane migration deserves more attention for improved forecasting of Arctic greenhouse gas emissions.</p>",

		"abstract": "Large national programs in the United States and several Asian countries have defined and characterised their marine methane hydrate occurrences in some detail, but European hydrate occurrence has received less attention. The European Union-funded project “Marine gas hydrate – an indigenous resource of natural gas for Europe” (MIGRATE) aimed to determine the European potential inventory of exploitable gas hydrate, to assess current technologies for their production, and to evaluate the associated risks. We present a synthesis of results from a MIGRATE working group that focused on the definition and assessment of hydrate in Europe. Our review includes the western and eastern margins of Greenland, the Barents Sea and onshore and offshore Svalbard, the Atlantic margin of Europe, extending south to the northwestern margin of Morocco, the Mediterranean Sea, the Sea of Marmara, and the western and southern margins of the Black Sea. We have not attempted to cover the high Arctic, the Russian, Ukrainian and Georgian sectors of the Black Sea, or overseas territories of European nations. Following a formalised process, we defined a range of indicators of hydrate presence based on geophysical, geochemical and geological data. Our study was framed by the constraint of the hydrate stability field in European seas. Direct hydrate indicators included sampling of hydrate; the presence of bottom simulating reflectors in seismic reflection profiles; gas seepage into the ocean; and chlorinity anomalies in sediment cores. Indirect indicators included geophysical survey evidence for seismic velocity and/or resistivity anomalies, seismic reflectivity anomalies or subsurface gas escape structures; various seabed features associated with gas escape, and the presence of an underlying conventional petroleum system. We used these indicators to develop a database of hydrate occurrence across Europe. We identified a series of regions where there is substantial evidence for hydrate occurrence (some areas offshore Greenland, offshore west Svalbard, the Barents Sea, the mid-Norwegian margin, the Gulf of Cadiz, parts of the eastern Mediterranean, the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea) and regions where the evidence is more tenuous (other areas offshore Greenland and of the eastern Mediterranean, onshore Svalbard, offshore Ireland and offshore northwest Iberia). We provide an overview of the evidence for hydrate occurrence in each of these regions. We conclude that around Europe, areas with strong evidence for the presence of hydrate commonly coincide with conventional thermogenic hydrocarbon provinces.",

CO2 injection into the brine-filled (1.0 wt.% NaCl) core plug was conducted at realistic reservoir conditions; the pore pressure was 20 bar and the temperature was 0.1 °C. Solid CO2 hydrate formed in the core plug after injecting 0.40 pore volumes (frac.) of CO2 and immediately reduced the apparent permeability to zero. A differential pressure across the core plug of 18 bar (200 bar/m) was sustained for 250 h without producing any CO2 from the core plug. This demonstrates the potential of CO2 hydrate formation as a secondary seal in settings with favorable CO2 hydrate formation conditions in or above the reservoir. The results further indicate that the self-sealing nature of CO2 hydrate should be considered while characterizing carbon sequestration reservoirs in both marine and permafrost-affected settings.",

		"abstract": "Dissociation of onshore natural gas hydrates (NGHs) could lead to the release of methane directly to the atmosphere, especially in Arctic regions such as Svalbard, where enhanced climate warming has the capacity to promote rapid methane evasion to the atmosphere following the decay of permafrost and glacier ice. Here we present the first assessment of the NGH stability zone (GHSZ) in central Spitsbergen, a climate-sensitive part of Svalbard where thermobaric conditions appear favourable for onshore NGH formation. We developed an approach incorporating regionally constrained 3-dimensional parameterisation of temperature, pressure and phase boundary (93% methane, 7% ethane, 35 ppt salinity) to define the GHSZ. This resulted in an up to 650 m thick (mean: 308 m) GHSZ covering 74.8% of the study area, thickening significantly in the east where the climate is colder. Perturbation of the base case parameters was undertaken to quantify the sensitivity of the GHSZ to the variation in environmental conditions across the study area. We present 26 examples of these deterministic scenarios and show that the largest changes in the GHSZ were observed when either the ethane content (to 20%) or the regional pore water pressure (to 125% hydrostatic) were increased. The GHSZ also increased markedly when the geothermal gradient was reduced from 33 to 26 °C km−1, but was almost completely inhibited by a dry gas (100% methane), greater salinity (50 ppt), or exposure to an increase in surface temperatures relative to the mean annual air temperature (e.g., by 2 °C). Most parameters affected both the upper and the lower stability boundary of the GHSZ, with the exception of the geothermal gradient, which impacted primarily upon the latter. Given that Svalbard is host to a proven petroleum system, we conclude that NGHs almost certainly exist onshore Svalbard.",

Besides local fossil energy sources such as coal or shale gas in combination with carbon storage and sequestration, renewable sources such as geothermal energy are being considered as alternatives. A thorough assessment of the geothermal energy alternative relies on precise knowledge of the current heat-flow values. In addition, paleo-temperature gradients, former basin configuration and basin development are of great importance for the evaluation of all of these energy sources. We assessed the lateral distribution of the heat-flow for systematically logged commercial petroleum exploration and research boreholes using numerical models. For the Central Tertiary Basin, models were constrained with multi-physical data sets. Geothermal gradients ranging from 25 to 55 °C/km (33 °C/km on average) have been recorded, and these support the indication of local and regional heat-flows that exceed the global continental average.",

		"abstract": "At the heart of the traditional approach to strategy in the climate change dilemma lies the assumption that the global community, by applying a set of powerful analytical tools, can predict the future of climate change accurately enough to choose a clear strategic direction for it. We claim that this approach might involve underestimating uncertainty in order to lay out a vision of future events sufficiently precise to be captured in a  discounted cost flow analysis in integrated assessment models. However, since the future of climate change is truly uncertain, this approach might at  best be marginally helpful and at worst downright dangerous: underestimating uncertainty can lead to strategies that do not defend the world against unexpected and sometimes even catastrophic threats. Another danger lies on the other extreme: if the global community can not find a strategy that works under traditional analysis or if uncertainties are too large that clear messages are absent, they may abandon the analytical rigor of their planning process altogether and base their decisions on good instinct and consensus of some future process that is easy to agree upon. \n\nIn this paper, we try to outline a system to derive strategic decisions under uncertainty for the climate change dilemma. What follows is a framework for determining the level of uncertainty surrounding strategic decisions and for tailoring strategy to that uncertainty. \n\nOur core argument is that a robust strategy towards climate change involves the building of a technological portfolio of mitigation and adaptation measures that includes sufficient opposite technological positions to the underlying baseline emission scenarios given the uncertainties of the entire physical and socioeconomic system in place. In the case of mitigation, opposite technological positions with the highest leverage are particular types of sinks. A robust climate risk management portfolio can only work when the opposite technological positions are readily available when needed and therefore have to be prepared in advance. It is precisely the flexibility of these technological options which has to be quantified under the perspective of the uncertain nature of the underlying system and compared to the cost of creating these options, rather than comparing their cost with expected losses in a net present value type analysis. We conclude that climate policy - especially under the consideration of the precautionary principle - would look much different if uncertainties would be taken explicitly into account.",

		"abstract": "In this article, we explore the world’s response to the increasing impact of carbon emissions on the sobering threat posed by global warming: the carbon offset market. Though the market is a relatively new one, numerous offset providers have quickly emerged under both regulated and voluntary regimes. Owing to the lack of technical literacy of some stakeholders who participate in the market, no common quality or certification structure has yet emerged for providers. To the contrary, the media warns that a relative “cowboy” atmosphere prevails in the current environment, and that there are “widespread instances of people and organizations buying worthless credits that do not yield any reductions in carbon emissions” (Harvey and Fidler, Financial Times, 2007). At this point in the evolution of the market, only a handful of offset provider-rating schemes exist; and, even these systems leave consumers with few answers when they seek to find a means by which to ensure that the said systems are having their intended impact. The purpose of this article is, first, to provide a grounded understanding of the nature of the offset market, a tendency toward carbon neutrality as a possible point of equilibrium, and the ethical tensions that surround it from the perspective of the consuming public. Second, we outline the standards environment for offset providers to illustrate most effectively the need for a single set of criteria among providers that is readily understandable by the common consumer stakeholder. We then explore the differences among the providers and articulate the specific criteria upon which providers may be evaluated by this particular stakeholder constituency, by bringing together best practices based on currently available analyses. Finally, we share the results of preliminary data collection in connection with 117 offset providers and highlight early findings. These findings allow us comparing providers effectively and efficiently on a common scale that services both providers, who thereby have greater guidance for self-assessment purposes, as well as consumer stakeholders, who then have the ability to make useful and more informed choices about carbon emission reduction in the future.",

		"abstract": "Carbon offsetting can be loosely characterized as a mechanism by which an organization or individual contributes to a scheme that is projected either to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or to deliver carbon dioxide emission reductions on the part of other organizations or individuals. An activity that has been offset therefore purports to make no long-term net contribution to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The ethical basis for using carbon offsetting as an approach to tackling climate change is very much contested. We seek to expose some of the underlying reasons for these ethical disagreements. We show that they relate both to empirical disagreements about what the likely benefits of offsetting are and, more fundamentally, to principled disagreements about the right way to discharge duties to deliver carbon reductions.

		"abstract": "A vital new moral perspective on the climate change debate. Esteemed philosopher John Broome avoids the familiar ideological stances on climate change policy and examines the issue through an invigorating new lens. As he considers the moral dimensions of climate change, he reasons clearly through what universal standards of goodness and justice require of us, both as citizens and as governments. His conclusions—some as demanding as they are logical—will challenge and enlighten. Eco-conscious readers may be surprised to hear they have a duty to offset all their carbon emissions, while policy makers will grapple with Broome’s analysis of what if anything is owed to future generations. From the science of greenhouse gases to the intricate logic of cap and trade, Broome reveals how the principles that underlie everyday decision making also provide simple and effective ideas for confronting climate change. Climate Matters is an essential contribution to one of the paramount issues of our time.",

		"abstract": "Many companies offer their customers voluntary carbon ‘offset’ certificates to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions. Voluntary offset certificates are cheap because the demand for them is low, allowing consumers to compensate for their emissions without significant sacrifices. Regarding the distribution of emission reduction responsibilities I argue that excess emissions are permissible if they are offset properly. However, if individuals buy offsets only because they are cheap, they fail to be robustly motivated to choose a permissible course of action. This suspected lack of robust motivation raises both pragmatic questions about the functioning of offsetting schemes and moral questions about the worth of such unstable motives. The analysis provided here also has wider implications for the normative analysis of partial compliance and ‘many hands' problems, especially for those cases where compliance levels and costs interact.",

The results show that different lithological units can be identified based on the petrophysical data. The density of the samples remained nearly constant throughout the drilled section. Only diopside-tremolite skarns and black schists exhibit higher densities. The samples are dominated by the paramagnetic behaviour with occasional ferromagnetic signature caused by serpentinitic rocks. Large variations in seismic velocities, both at ambient pressure and under in situ crustal conditions are observed. The porosity of the samples, which is extremely low, is either intrinsic by nature or caused by decompaction related to fracturing during the core retrieval. It is noteworthy that these microfractures have dramatically lowered the VP and VS values. From the measured velocities and density data we have calculated the seismic impedances, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratios for the lithological units of the Outokumpu section and from these data the reflection coefficients for the major lithological boundaries, evident in the surveyed section, were determined. The data show that the strong and distinct reflections visible in wide-angle seismic surveys are caused by interfaces between diopside-tremolite skarn and either serpentinites, mica schist or black schist.",

		"abstract": "The identification of pore fluid type, saturation and distribution pattern within the pore space is of great significance as several seismic and petrophysical properties of porous rocks vary largely by fluid type, saturation and fluid distribution pattern. With the help of rock physics modeling, the impact of fluid saturation as well as fluid distribution pattern on seismic velocities, acoustic impedances and seismic amplitudes is estimated on porous rock of early Cretaceous Mississauga sands. For this purpose two saturation patterns: uniform and patchy saturations are considered within the pore spaces. The primary goal of this study is to understand the vertical and horizontal trends of numerous seismic parameters such as P-wave velocity (VP), S-wave velocity (VS), their impedances, VP/VSratio, bulk density (ρb), seismic reflectivity etc. as a function of fluid saturation, saturation pattern (patchy or homogeneous), porosity (ϕ) and clay content. The results reveal that the seismic parameters and offset dependent amplitudes are very sensitive to pore fluid saturation and distribution patterns and physical properties. As the hydrocarbons (oil/gas) saturation increases, the compressional wave velocity decreases. P-wave velocity is 20–40 % higher in case of patchy saturation than of homogeneous saturation. Similarly, reservoir porosity and clay matrix control the elastic response of porous rock due to which seismic velocities decrease with increase in porosity and clay content.",

		"abstract": "Analysis of wire line logs at Ocean Drilling Program Site 642, the deepest scientific hole yet drilled in an offshore large igneous province (LIP), reveals the main features of the extrusive complex constructed during formation of a volcanic margin. A characteristic cyclic log response images tholeiitic lavas and thin tuffs corresponding to the seaward dipping reflectors in the seismic record. Flows are 0.6–18.5 m thick, while most sediments are <l m thick. Porosity dependent sonic, density, neutron porosity and resistivity logs respond to gently decreasing porosity in upper 5–7 m of the flow and rapid porosity increase near the flow base. Velocity and density top and bottom gradients are largely independent of flow thickness, with velocity gradients of 400 to 600 s−1 and −1000 to −2000 s−1, respectively. A positive correlation between flow thickness and mean velocity simply reflects increased proportion of massive basalt in thicker flows. There is also an overall increase in mean fine-grained basalt velocity with depth with a gradient of 0.8±0.3 s−1. Flow velocity-density relations show a downward velocity strengthening related to a decrease in high aspect ratio voids. High velocities near the flow base correlate with high, >2000 Ω-m, focused resistivity kicks. The large flow-scale variations in physical properties show that representative core measurements must be densely sampled. Both on flow and sequence scales Site 642 log responses appears typical for the North Atlantic Volcanic Province and other LIPs but differs from logs in deep ocean crustal holes. Principal differences in log responses reflect mode of crustal emplacement and alteration. Hence Site 642 forms a reference hole for extrusive constructions on oceanic LIPs.",

		"abstract": "Skip to Next Section\nInterpretation of seismic data has played a major role in recent advances in the studies of igneous sill complexes. Seismic modelling studies based on field analogues represent a promising tool to close the scale gap between observations from outcrops and seismic data and support seismic interpretation. Virtual outcrop models are commonly used to include high-resolution geological structures in models of seismic-scale field analogues. However, realistic seismic modelling requires not only detailed structural input, but also well-constrained elastic properties and an adequate seismic modelling technique. Here, we present a seismic modelling study of oil-producing andesitic sills in the Neuquén Basin, Argentina, which implements all modelling elements at high accuracy by combining virtual outcrop models, well data and a 2(3)D filtering method. Our results indicate that the modelled seismic signatures of intrusive bodies observed in field analogues are characterized by frequency-dependent interference and strong amplitude variations owing to highly variable elastic properties of both host rock and sills. We demonstrate that detailed waveform patterns observed in real seismic data can be linked to intrusive bodies below the traditionally assumed limit of resolution via realistic seismic modelling. This illustrates how an integrated modelling approach based on field analogues can aid seismic interpretation.",

		"abstract": "Often, interpreters only have access to seismic sections and, at times, well data, when making an interpretation of structures and depositional features in the subsurface. The validity of the final interpretation is based on how well the seismic data are able to reproduce the actual geology, and seismic modeling can help constrain that. Ideally, modeling should create complete seismograms, which is often best achieved by finite-difference modeling with postprocessing to produce synthetic seismic sections for comparison purposes. Such extensive modeling is, however, not routinely affordable. A far more efficient option, using the simpler 1D convolution model with reflectivity logs extracted along verticals in velocity models, generates poor modeling results when lateral velocity variations are expected. A third and intermediate option is to use the various ray-based approaches available, which are efficient and flexible. However, standard ray methods, such as the normal-incidence point for unmigrated poststack sections or image rays for simulating time-migrated poststack results, cannot deal with complex and detailed targets, and will not reproduce the realistic (3D) resolution effects of seismic imaging. Nevertheless, ray methods can also be used to estimate 3D spatial prestack convolution operators, so-called point-spread functions. These are functions of the survey, velocity model, and wavelet, among others, and therefore they include 3D angle-dependent illumination and resolution effects. Prestack depth migration images are thus rapidly simulated by spatial convolution with detailed 3D reflectivity models, which goes far beyond the limits of 1D convolution modeling. This 3D convolution modeling should allow geologists to better assess their interpretations and draw more definitive conclusions.",

Since 1997, the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) has been the authoritative source of bathymetry for the Arctic Ocean. IBCAO has merged its efforts with the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO-Seabed 2030 Project, with the goal of mapping all of the oceans by 2030. Here we present the latest version (IBCAO Ver. 4.0), with more than twice the resolution (200 × 200 m versus 500 × 500 m) and with individual depth soundings constraining three times more area of the Arctic Ocean (∼19.8% versus 6.7%), than the previous IBCAO Ver. 3.0 released in 2012. Modern multibeam bathymetry comprises ∼14.3% in Ver. 4.0 compared to ∼5.4% in Ver. 3.0. Thus, the new IBCAO Ver. 4.0 has substantially more seafloor morphological information that offers new insights into a range of submarine features and processes; for example, the improved portrayal of Greenland fjords better serves predictive modelling of the fate of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",

To clarify this relationship we compile a data set of probable gas hydrate occurrence as appraised from well logs of 788 industry wells in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We combine the well log data set with a data set of BSR distribution in the same area identified from 3-D seismic data. We find that a BSR increases the chances of finding gas hydrate by 2.6 times as opposed to drilling outside a BSR and that the wells within a BSR also contain thicker and higher resistivity hydrate accumulations. Even so, over half of the wells drilled through BSRs have no detectable gas hydrate accumulations and gas hydrate occurrences and BSRs do not coincide in most cases.",

		"abstract": "A new correlation for predicting the hydrate-free zone of reservoir fluids, from black oil to lean natural gas, has been developed. The method correlates the hydrate dissociation pressure against the specific gravity and the concentration of the hydrate-forming components in the fluid, as well as the temperature of the system. The effect of nitrogen and carbon dioxide on the hydrate-free zone has also been taken into account. The correlation has been developed using hydrate phase boundaries for 31 fluids generated by a well-proven comprehensive thermodynamic model. Hydrate phase boundaries for 13 independent reservoir fluids calculated by the new correlation and the thermodynamic model have been compared, showing a maximum error of 1.0 K in the calculated potential hydrate-forming temperature.Gas hydrates are crystalline compounds formed from a combination of gas and water molecules. They resemble ice in appearance but unlike ice they can form at relatively high temperatures. Gas hydrates generate considerable operational and safety concerns in subsea pipelines and process equipment. The current practice in the oil/gas industry for avoiding gas hydrate problems is operating outside the hydrate stability zone.Since 1945 the gas gravity method given by Katz1 has been an indispensable simple tool for predicting the gas hydrate stability zone. Despite the development of more sophisticated predictive tools, such as the vapor-solid equilibrium ratio (Ki value) method2,3 or the solid-solution theory of van der Waals and Platteeuw,4 the gas gravity method has kept its popularity among engineers in the petroleum industry. The main advantage of this technique is the availability of input data (it only requires the specific gravity of the mixture, i.e., the average molecular weight of the gas mixture divided by that of air) and the simplicity of the calculation which can be performed by using charts or hand-held calculators.The original gas gravity method is only applicable to dry gas systems. However, the development of offshore/arctic oil and gas condensate fields necessitates a robust and simple method for predicting the hydrate stability zone for these systems.This paper presents a general correlation which extends the Katz's gas gravity method to all real reservoir fluids (i.e., dry gas, gas condensate, and oil). The correlation, which has been developed using data from a wide range of reservoir fluids, has proven to be reliable despite its simplicity. It only requires information on the specific gravity and concentration of hydrate-forming components in the system. The developed correlation can be used in hand-held calculators as a tool for estimating the hydrate stability zone for petroleum fluids, as well as providing an initial guess for more sophisticated computer programs.Although only hydrate-free zones of fluids in the presence of distilled water have been considered in this work, the effect of salts or thermodynamic inhibitors could be estimated by coupling this method with the original Hammerschmidt equation5 or the equation by Nielsen and Bucklin.6The development of the new correlation was based on hydrate phase boundaries calculated by a comprehensive thermodynamic model, the Heriot-Watt U. Hydrate Program, HWHYD. In the HWHYD model, the Valderrama modification of the Patel and Teja (VPT) equation of state7 with a nondensity dependent (NDD) mixing rule8 is used in modeling all fluid phases. The hydrate phases are modeled by the solid-solution theory of van der Waals and Platteeuw4 as implemented by Cole and Goodwin.9 The Kihara model for spherical molecules10 is applied in order to calculate the potential function for components forming the hydrate phases. A detailed description of the numerical modeling is given elsewhere.11 The thermodynamic model has proven reliable in predicting the hydrate-free zone of reservoir fluids.12–16The correlation was based on the comprehensive thermodynamic model rather than on real experimental data for the following reasons. First, the amount of experimental hydrate dissociation data on multicomponent mixtures, especially oil and gas condensate, is very limited. Second, because of the limited experimental data, any experimental error could easily result in unsuccessful correlation of fluid properties.Recent work in this department has shown that the stable hydrate structure in real reservoir fluids is hydrate structure II.12,17,18 Exceptions are very lean gases where structure I is expected to be the stable hydrate structure. Therefore, all calculated hydrate phase boundaries in this work are structure II hydrate phase boundaries.It has been shown that structure II forming heavy hydrate formers (i.e., molecules larger than n-butane, such as cyclopentane, benzene, etc.) can reduce the hydrate-free zone of reservoir fluids.12 Commonly, however, reservoir fluid components are only well characterized up to, and including, C5. C6 and heavier compounds are typically lumped into single carbon number (SCN) groups, i.e., no information on single heavy hydrate formers is available. Therefore, it was not possible to take into account the effect of heavy hydrate formers, as such information was not available for the 31 systems used in the development of the correlation. Hence, the effect of heavy hydrate formers has, therefore, been ignored. In the following, when developing the new correlation, hydrate-forming components have been defined as components up to and including butanes in size.Hydrate phase boundaries generated by HWHYD, combined with information on the specific gravity and concentration of the hydrate forming components in the 31 fluids in Table A-1,12-14,19-28 were used as input for a multidimension regression procedure, utilizing least-square optimization routines. The objective function was defined as the relative error between the hydrate dissociation pressure determined by the comprehensive thermodynamic model and the pressures calculated by the tested equations.The new correlation was developed in several steps. First, a correlation for hydrocarbon-only mixtures was established. The fluids listed in Table A-1 in Appendix A on a hydrocarbon-only basis were used in this optimization. Next, various amounts of nitrogen and carbon dioxide were separately added to the fluids listed in Table A-1 to obtain further equations for the effect of these components on the hydrate dissociation pressures. Using a similar approach, a correlation for hydrogen sulphide was also considered. However, the effect of this compound on the hydrate dissociation pressure could not be successfully correlated. Hence, the effect of hydrogen sulphide has not been modeled for the time being.",

		"abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> The bacterially mediated aerobic methane oxidation (MO<sub>x</sub>) is a key mechanism in controlling methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from the world's oceans to the atmosphere. In this study, we investigated MO<sub>x</sub> in the Arctic fjord Storfjorden (Svalbard) by applying a combination of radio-tracer-based incubation assays (<sup>3</sup>H-CH<sub>4</sub> and <sup>14</sup>C-CH<sub>4</sub>), stable C-CH<sub>4</sub> isotope measurements, and molecular tools (16S rRNA gene Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting, <i>pmoA</i>- and <i>mxaF</i> gene analyses). Storfjorden is stratified in the summertime with melt water (MW) in the upper 60 m of the water column, Arctic water (ArW) between 60 and 100 m, and brine-enriched shelf water (BSW) down to 140 m. CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations were supersaturated with respect to the atmospheric equilibrium (about 3–4 nM) throughout the water column, increasing from &sim;20 nM at the surface to a maximum of 72 nM at 60 m and decreasing below. MO<sub>x</sub> rate measurements at near in situ CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations (here measured with <sup>3</sup>H-CH<sub>4</sub> raising the ambient CH<sub>4</sub> pool by &lt;2 nM) showed a similar trend: low rates at the sea surface, increasing to a maximum of &sim;2.3 nM day<sup>−1</sup> at 60 m, followed by a decrease in the deeper ArW/BSW. In contrast, rate measurements with <sup>14</sup>C-CH<sub>4</sub> (incubations were spiked with &sim;450 nM of <sup>14</sup>C-CH<sub>4</sub>, providing an estimate of the CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation at elevated concentration) showed comparably low turnover rates (&lt;1 nM day<sup>−1</sup>) at 60 m, and peak rates were found in ArW/BSW at &sim;100 m water depth, concomitant with increasing <sup>13</sup>C values in the residual CH<sub>4</sub> pool. Our results indicate that the MO<sub>x</sub> community in the surface MW is adapted to relatively low CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations. In contrast, the activity of the deep-water MO<sub>x</sub> community is relatively low at the ambient, summertime CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations but has the potential to increase rapidly in response to CH<sub>4</sub> availability. A similar distinction between surface and deep-water MO<sub>x</sub> is also suggested by our molecular analyses. The DGGE banding patterns of 16S rRNA gene fragments of the surface MW and deep water were clearly different. A DGGE band related to the known type I MO<sub>x</sub> bacterium <i>Methylosphaera</i> was observed in deep BWS, but absent in surface MW. Furthermore, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplicons of the deep water with the two functional primers sets <i>pmoA</i> and <i>mxaF</i> showed, in contrast to those of the surface MW, additional products besides the expected one of 530 base pairs (bp). Apparently, different MO<sub>x</sub> communities have developed in the stratified water masses in Storfjorden, which is possibly related to the spatiotemporal variability in CH<sub>4</sub> supply to the distinct water masses.</p>",

		"abstract": "The paper presents an optimized method of digital terrain model (DTM) estimation based on modified kriging interpolation. Many methods are used for digital terrain model creation; the most popular methods are: inverse distance weighing, nearest neighbour, moving average, and kriging. The latter is often considered to be one of the best methods for interpolation of non-uniform spatial data, but the good results with respect to model&rsquo;s accuracy come at the price of very long computational time. In this study, the optimization of the kriging method was performed for the purpose of seabed DTM creation based on millions of measurement points obtained from a multibeam echosounder device (MBES). The purpose of the optimization was to significantly decrease computation time, while maintaining the highest possible accuracy of created model. Several variants of kriging method were analysed (depending on search radius, minimum of required points, fixed number of points, and used smoothing method). The analysis resulted in a proposed optimization of the kriging method, utilizing a new technique of neighbouring points selection throughout the interpolation process (named &ldquo;growing radius&rdquo;). Experimental results proved the new kriging method to have significant advantages when applied to DTM estimation.",

Fluid Phase Equilibria, 94: 181-216. A cubic equation of state, with simple non-density-dependent mixing rules, is used to represent the phase behaviour of multicomponent mixtures containing hydrocarbons up to n-octane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, water and methanol. The reliability of the model is tested against diverse experimental VL and VLL equilibrium data of multicomponent systems. The proposed correlation can be applied for efficient design and operation of transfer lines and processing units. The practical value of the theoretically correct concept of density dependence is tested on a density-dependent version of the above mixing rules. It is demonstrated that while both mixing rules produce very similar results when only one polar component is present, the density-dependent mixing rules may be inferior for mixtures containing both water and methanol, owing to an inherent deficiency. It is also demonstrated that an invariant version of the proposed non-density-dependent mixing rule may not lead to indisputably improved predictions for the studied systems.",

Pressure-temperature estimates on garnet websterites, and temperature estimates on two-pyroxene granulites and spinel lherzolites, allow definition of a stratigraphic sequence and the ambient geotherm. The crust is ca. 27 km thick and its lower part consists of mafic (gabbroic to anorthositic) meta-igneous granulites. The uppermost mantle consists of Cr-diopside spinel lherzolite, mixed with pyroxenites and metapyroxenites. The xenolith data are compatible with available geophysical data. The xenolith-defined geothermal gradient is even higher than one previously derived for eastern Australia, and comparable to that for the Rio Grande Rift. The high ambient temperatures probably reflect the addition of heat by basaltic magmas, to the base of a continental crust thinned by rifting only 10–15 Ma ago.",

		"abstract": "Dykes play a major role in transporting magma through the crust to subsurface storage reservoirs or eruption sites at the surface. The geometry, connectivity, and internal textures of dykes preserve an important record of dyke emplacement, linkage, and magma flow dynamics. Unravelling these facets of dyke evolution is critical to interpreting signals of magma migration in active volcanoes as well as tectonic processes, including crust formation and continental break-up during hazard assessment. Unfortunately, our ability to develop new insights is limited by the continuity of high precision data that can be extracted from the field. The emergence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, a.k.a. drones), photogrammetry and other sensor techniques are set to greatly improve our field capabilities by collecting data at higher density and with greater precision. Here we present a workflow emphasising best-practise in UAV survey design, the construction of photogrammetric models and standardised reporting of those models. Emphasis is given to the factors that should be considered in order to resolve the geological features of interest in any study (e.g. wall rock fractures, chilled margins, magmatic breccias, dyke apertures etc.). A point-to-raster technique is documented that measures spatial error in the rasters that are derived from photogrammetric models (e.g. orthomosaics and digital elevation models). Using three case studies, we show how dyke swarms can be mapped accurately over areas approaching 1 km2, at sub-centimetre resolution. The data illustrate how questions about dyke-induced deformation, host rock controls on segmentation and aperture variation may be addressed, and we present a method for the high density, high precision measurement of dyke apertures in 3D. We also review semi-automated mapping tools and emerging UAV sensing techniques, including hyperspectral and aeromagnetic sensors, and the potentially important contributions they will make to the study of intrusive systems and volcanology more broadly.",

In conjunction with the rapidly increasing availability of imagery, particularly from unmanned aerial vehicles, SfM photogrammetry represents a powerful tool for geomorphological research. However, to fully realize this potential, its application must be carefully underpinned by photogrammetric considerations, surveys should be reported in sufficient detail to be repeatable (if practical) and results appropriately assessed to understand fully the potential errors involved. To deliver these goals, robust survey and reporting must be supported through (i) using appropriate survey design, (ii) applying suitable statistics to identify systematic error (bias) and to estimate precision within results, and (iii) propagating uncertainty estimates into the final data products. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

		"abstract": "Structure from Motion–Multi-View Stereo (SfM-MVS) is a relatively new technique that is being adopted in the analysis of sedimentary systems. The technique is especially applicable to studies which focus on the distribution, geometry and quantification of geological bodies including the analysis of sedimentary forms and tectonic structures. This photogrammetric method allows for generating virtual outcrops (VO) and high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs). In comparison with more sophisticated and expensive techniques such as airborne LiDAR scanning or terrestrial laser scanning, SfM-MVS is a fast low-cost method which with careful use of ground control points, can produce models which are comparable to other digital survey methods for spatial accuracy. In this study, the effectiveness of SfM-MVS in a series of quantitative case studies in sedimentary and basin analyses is discussed. Focus is placed on how the research questions define the workflow strategy to know the limitations, sources of error and potential utility that the SFM-MVS technique has when a virtual sedimentary system is interpreted. Three case studies of different sedimentary environments, previously analyzed with traditional fieldwork techniques, were selected and re-analyzed. For each case study the objective was to resolve quantitative questions that were not possible to determine without the use of VO or DTMs. Questions include: (i) geometrical restoration of a growth strata succession associated with thrust systems; (ii) stacking patterns of littoral ridges during a relative sea-level fall after the Holocene climatic optimum; and (iii) quantification of lake level fall during the past 44 years of a closed lake basin. The results of the work show that the technique has significant application in the analysis of sedimentary systems. However, since geological interpretations depend on the quality of the models that are generated, planning and construction of the VO or DEMs along with their validation are essential to ensure reliable results.",

Image mosaics from these cameras are essential in mapping the surface geology and selecting locations for analysis by other instruments on the rover's payload. 2-D images do not truly portray the depth of field of features within an image, nor their 3-D geometry. This paper describes a new 3-D visualization software tool for geological analysis of Martian rover-derived Digital Outcrop Models created using photogrammetric processing of stereo-images using the Planetary Robotics Vision Processing tool developed for 3-D vision processing of ExoMars PanCam and Mars 2020 Mastcam-Z data. Digital Outcrop Models are rendered in real time in the Planetary Robotics 3-D Viewer PRo3D, allowing scientists to roam outcrops as in a terrestrial field campaign. Digitization of point, line, and polyline features is used for measuring the physical dimensions of geological features and communicating interpretations. Dip and strike of bedding and fractures is measured by digitizing a polyline along the contact or fracture trace, through which a best fit plane is plotted. The attitude of this plane is calculated in the software. Here we apply these tools to analysis of sedimentary rock outcrops and quantification of the geometry of fracture systems encountered by the science teams of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity and Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity. We show the benefits PRo3D allows for visualization and collection of geological interpretations and analyses from rover-derived stereo-images.",

		"abstract": "Drones have revolutionised the gathering of geoenvironmental data over the last decade. To date, the majority of drone studies of sedimentary rock successions have focussed on well-exposed vertical to subvertical cliff sections. Here, we describe a fundamental method to obtain new data and perspectives on sedimentary successions exposed in partially-obscured foreshore or other horizontal to subhorizontal outcrop surfaces using drones. We illustrate the technique using an example from foreshore exposures of Jurassic strata near Helmsdale, Scotland, UK. Our method aims to make the process of safely collecting drone footage accessible and covers practical considerations from pre-field preparation to data processing. Capturing drone imagery in a foreshore setting involves trade-offs between the time of day which constrains the lighting, the time of year which determines algal cover and tidal range, and the flight time available which indirectly governs image resolution. We show how: (1) orthomosaic images can be used to view sedimentary deposits at different scales and angles enabling identification of large-scale sedimentary features marked by small-scale changes in orientation and lateral variability; (2) production of digital elevation models permits differentially weathered features covered by water or algae to be distinguished, and (3) drones can be used for close up photography of inaccessible features.",

		"abstract": "Coastal managers require reliable spatial data on the extent and timing of potential coastal inundation, particularly in a changing climate. Most sea level rise (SLR) vulnerability assessments are undertaken using the easily implemented bathtub approach, where areas adjacent to the sea and below a given elevation are mapped using a deterministic line dividing potentially inundated from dry areas. This method only requires elevation data usually in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM). However, inherent errors in the DEM and spatial analysis of the bathtub model propagate into the inundation mapping. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of spatially variable and spatially correlated elevation errors in high-spatial resolution DEMs for mapping coastal inundation. Elevation errors were best modelled using regression-kriging. This geostatistical model takes the spatial correlation in elevation errors into account, which has a significant impact on analyses that include spatial interactions, such as inundation modelling. The spatial variability of elevation errors was partially explained by land cover and terrain variables. Elevation errors were simulated using sequential Gaussian simulation, a Monte Carlo probabilistic approach. 1,000 error simulations were added to the original DEM and reclassified using a hydrologically correct bathtub method. The probability of inundation to a scenario combining a 1 in 100 year storm event over a 1 m SLR was calculated by counting the proportion of times from the 1,000 simulations that a location was inundated. This probabilistic approach can be used in a risk-aversive decision making process by planning for scenarios with different probabilities of occurrence. For example, results showed that when considering a 1% probability exceedance, the inundated area was approximately 11% larger than mapped using the deterministic bathtub approach. The probabilistic approach provides visually intuitive maps that convey uncertainties inherent to spatial data and analysis.",

		"abstract": "This paper reports on the use of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (sUAV) carrying a standard compact camera, to construct a high resolution orthomosaic (OM) and digital elevation model (DEM) over the lower reaches of the glacier Midtre Lovénbreen, Svalbard. Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques were used to build the OM and DEM, and together these reveal insights into the nature of supra-glacial drainage. Major meandering supra-glacial drainage pathways show clear dynamism, via meander cutoffs and abandoned channels. In addition, the imagery reveals a very extensive network of smaller channels that may well carry substantial amounts of water. This network of channels is in part controlled by the structure of the glacier, but in turn, these channels have a significant impact on the ice surface. Roughness of the ice surface is higher where channels are most extensive. In addition, we find a relationship between channel density and surface reflectance, such that greater channel density is associated with lower reflectance values. Given the role of surface reflectance and roughness in the energy balance of glaciers, it is therefore apparent that extensive networks of small supra-glacial channels across such glaciers have the potential to have an important impact on energy exchanges between the atmosphere and the ice surface.

		"abstract": "Ice-cored lateral–frontal moraines are common at the margins of receding high-Arctic valley glaciers, but the preservation potential of these features within the landform record is unclear. Recent climatic amelioration provides an opportunity to study the morphological evolution of these landforms as they de-ice. This is important because high-Arctic glacial landsystems have been used as analogues for formerly glaciated areas in the mid-latitudes. This study uses SfM (Structure-from-Motion) photogrammetry and a combination of archive aerial and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) derived imagery to investigate the degradation of an ice-cored lateral–frontal moraine at Austre Lovénbreen, Svalbard. Across the study area as a whole, over an 11-year period, the average depth of surface lowering was −1.75±0.89m. The frontal sections of the moraine showed low or undetectable rates of change. Spatially variable rates of surface lowering are associated with differences in the quantity of buried ice within the structure of the moraine. Morphological change was dominated by surface lowering, with limited field evidence of degradation via back-wastage. This permits the moraine a greater degree of stability than previously observed at other sites in Svalbard. It is unclear whether the end point will be a fully stabilised ice-cored moraine, in equilibrium with its environment, or an ice-free lateral–frontal moraine complex. Controls on geomorphological change (e.g. topography and climate) and the preservation potential of the lateral–frontal moraine are discussed. The methods used by this research also demonstrate the potential value of SfM photogrammetry and unmanned aerial vehicles for monitoring environmental change and are likely to have wider applications in other geoscientific sub-disciplines.",

The target siliciclastic storage unit, which is encountered at approx. 670 m depth at the potential injection site in Adventdalen, central Spitsbergen, is a severely under-pressured (at least 35 bar), tight and compartmentalised reservoir with significant contribution of natural fractures to permeability. In this contribution, we characterise the 15–24 m-thick Wilhelmøya Subgroup storage unit using both borehole and outcrop data and present water-injection test results that indicate the presence of fluid-flow barriers and the generation of new, and propagation of pre-existing natural fractures during injection. Whole core samples from drillcores and outcrops were sampled for pore network characterisation and analysed using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (Micro-CT). We demonstrate that heterogeneities such as structural discontinuities, igneous bodies and lateral facies variations, as examined in well core and equivalent outcrops, will strongly influence fluid flow in the target reservoir, both by steering and baffling fluid migration. Many of these heterogeneities are considered to be subseismic, and their detailed characterisation is important to predict subsurface CO2 storage potential and optimise injection strategy.",

		"abstract": "Brittle and ductile deformation of alternating layers of Devonian sandstone and mudstone at Cape Liptrap, Victoria, Australia, resulted in upright folds with associated fold accommodation faults and multiple fracture sets. Structures were mapped at the Fold Stack locality at Cape Liptrap using high-resolution aerial photographs acquired by a digital camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Subsequent photogrammetric modelling resulted in georeferenced spatial datasets (point cloud, digital elevation model and orthophotograph) with sub-cm resolution and cm accuracy, which were used to extract brittle and ductile structure orientation data. An extensive dataset of bedding measurements derived from the dense point cloud was used to compute a 3D implicit structural trend model to visualise along-strike changes of Devonian (Tabberabberan) folds at the Fold Stack locality and to estimate bulk shortening strain. This model and newly collected data indicate that first generation shallowly south-southwest plunging upright folds were gently refolded about a steeply plunging/subvertical fold axis during a Devonian low-strain north–south shortening event. This also led to the local tightening of first generation folds and possibly strike-slip movement along regional scale faults. In order to distinguish fractures associated with Devonian compression from those that formed during Cretaceous extension and later inversion, we compared the five fracture sets defined at Cape Liptrap to previously mapped joints and faults within the overlying sedimentary cover rocks of the Cretaceous Strzelecki Group (Gippsland Basin), which crop out nearby. An east-southeast trending fracture set that is not evident in the Strzelecki Group can be linked to the formation of Devonian folds. Additionally, hinge line traces extracted from the Fold Stack dataset are aligned parallel to a dominant fracture set within the overlying cover sediments. This suggests that basement structures (folds and coeval parallel faults) have an important influence on fault and joint orientations within Cretaceous cover rocks.",

The targeted storage sandstones offer moderate secondary porosity and low permeability (unconventional reservoir), whereas water injection tests evidence good lateral fluid flow facilitated by extensive fracturing. Therefore, a detailed investigation of fracture sets/discontinuities and their characteristics have been undertaken, concentrating on the upper reservoir interval (670–706 m). Datasets include drill cores and well logs, and observations of outcrops, that mainly show fracturing but also some disaggregation deformation bands in the sandstones. The fracture distribution has a lithostratigraphical relationship, and can be subdivided into: (A) massive to laminated shaly intervals, offering abundant lower-angle shear fractures; (B) massive to thin-bedded, heterogeneous, mixed silty–shaly intervals, with a predominance of non-systematic, pervasive bed-confined fractures; and (C) massive to laminated, medium- to thick-bedded, fine- to coarse-grained sandstones with a lower frequency of mostly steep fractures. These domains represent pseudo-geomechanical units characterized by specific fracture sets and fracture intensity, with indicated relationships between the bed thickness and fracture intensity, and with domains separated along bedding interfaces. We discuss the impact of these lithostructural domains on the fluid flow pathways in the heterolithic storage unit.",

		"abstract": "Fluid redistribution in the crust is influenced by hydraulic gradient, by existing permeability anisotropy arising from bedding and other forms of layering, and by structural permeability developed under the prevailing stress field. Field evidence suggests that mesh structures, comprising faults interlinked with extensional-shear and purely extensional vein-fractures, form important conduits for large volume flow of hydrothermal and hydrocarbon fluids. Meshes may be ‘self-generated’ by the infiltration of pressurised fluids into a stressed heterogeneous rock mass with varying material properties, developing best where bulk coaxial strain is symmetric with existing layering, but they also form under predominantly simple shear. Fluid passage through such structures generates earthquake swarm activity by distributed fault-valve action along suprahydrostatic gradients that may arise from compaction overpressuring, metamorphic dewatering, magmatic intrusion, and mantle degassing. Within mesh structures, strong directional permeability may develop in the σ2 direction parallel to fault-fracture intersections and orthogonal to fault slip vectors. In particular tectonic settings, this promotes strongly focused flow with high potential for mineralisation. Mesh activation requires the condition Pf ~ σ3 to be maintained for the structures to remain high permeability conduits, requiring fluid overpressuring at other than shallow depths in extensional-transtensional regimes. Favoured localities for mesh development include linkage structures along large-displacement fault zones such as dilational jogs, lateral ramps, and transfer faults. In some circumstances, mesh formation appears to precede the development of major faults.",

		"abstract": "Geological aspects of the cap-rock problem were investigated on a worldwide scale in order to provide guide-lines for assessing the sealing and retention risk in exploration ventures. The most common caprock lithologies are shales and evaporites, which have typical thicknesses of tens to hundreds of meters. Regional seals are often provided by evaporitic sabkha environments and transgressive and regressive shales. Cap-rocks must be placed in the frame of a hydrocarbon habitat which evolves with time to judge properly the retention risk. Important parameters are rate of diffusion of hydrocarbons through cap-rocks, and fracture development as a function of the intensity of geomechanical deformation. When losses due to seal failure and diflusion occur, replenishment from an active generation-migration system may counter-balance the loss. “Giant” oil- and gasfields serve as a yardstick for measuring shale—evaporite ratios and seal depths. Surface seepages can provide a measure of seal failure. As the cap-rock problem is in an initial stage of research, many uncertainties affect the reliability of semi-quantitative statements on risks of sealing and retention.",

		"abstract": "Capture and subsurface storage of CO2 is widely viewed as being a necessary component of any strategy to minimise and control the continued increase in average global temperatures. Existing oil and gas reservoirs can be re-used for carbon storage, providing a substantial fraction of the vast amounts of subsurface storage space that will be required for the implementation of carbon storage at an industrial scale. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) in depleted reservoirs aims to ensure subsurface containment, both to satisfy safety considerations, and to provide confidence that the containment will continue over the necessary timescales. Other technical issues that need to be addressed include the risk of unintended subsurface events, such as induced seismicity. Minimisation of these risks is key to building confidence in CCS technology, both in relation to financing/liability, and the development and maintenance of public acceptance. These factors may be of particular importance with regard to CCS projects involving depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, where the mechanical effects of production activities must also be considered. Given the importance of caprock behaviour in this context, several previously published geomechanical caprock studies of depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs are identified and reviewed, comprising experimental and numerical studies of fourteen CCS pilot sites in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, in seven countries (Algeria, Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, UK). Particular emphasis is placed on the amount and types of data collected, the mathematical methods and codes used to conduct geomechanical analysis, and the relationship between geomechanical aspects and public perception. Sound geomechanical assessment, acting to help minimise operational and financial/liability risks, and the careful recognition of the impact of public perception are two key factors that can contribute to the development of a successful CCS project in a depleted hydrocarbon reservoir.",

During December 2016 a survey of the Chã das Caldeiras area was conducted using a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and real-time kinematic (RTK) global navigation satellite system (GNSS), with the objective of improving the terrain models and visible imagery derived from satellite platforms, from metric to decimetric resolution and accuracy. The main result is a very high resolution and quality 3D point cloud with a root mean square error of 0.08 <span class=\"inline-formula\">m</span> in <span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>X</i></span>, 0.11 <span class=\"inline-formula\">m</span> in <span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>Y</i></span> and 0.12 <span class=\"inline-formula\">m</span> in <span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>Z</i></span>, which fully covers the most recent lava flows. The survey comprises an area of 23.9 <span class=\"inline-formula\">km<sup>2</sup></span> and used 2909 calibrated images with an average ground sampling distance of 7.2 <span class=\"inline-formula\">cm</span>. The dense point cloud, digital surface models and orthomosaics with 25 and 10 <span class=\"inline-formula\">cm</span> resolutions, a 50 <span class=\"inline-formula\">cm</span> spaced elevation contour shapefile, and a 3D texture mesh, as well as the full aerial survey dataset are provided. The delineation of the 2014/15 lava flows covers an area of 4.53 <span class=\"inline-formula\">km<sup>2</sup></span>, which is smaller but more accurate than the previous estimates from 4.8 to 4.97 <span class=\"inline-formula\">km<sup>2</sup></span>. The difference in the calculated area, when compared to previously reported values, is due to a more detailed mapping of the flow geometry and to the exclusion of the areas corresponding to kīpukas (outcrops surrounded by lava flows). Our study provides a very high resolution dataset of the areas affected by Fogo's latest eruption and is a case study supporting the advantageous use of UAV aerial photography surveys in disaster-prone areas. This dataset provides accurate baseline data for future eruptions, allowing for different applications in Earth system sciences, such as hydrology, ecology and spatial modelling, as well as to planning.

Three main contributions are presented. First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem.",

		"abstract": "Accurate, precise and rapid acquisition of topographic data is fundamental to many sub-disciplines of physical geography. Technological developments over the past few decades have made fully distributed data sets of centimetric resolution and accuracy commonplace, yet the emergence of Structure from Motion (SfM) with Multi-View Stereo (MVS) in recent years has revolutionised three-dimensional topographic surveys in physical geography by democratising data collection and processing. SfM-MVS originates from the fields of computer vision and photogrammetry, requires minimal expensive equipment or specialist expertise and, under certain conditions, can produce point clouds of comparable quality to existing survey methods (e.g. Terrestrial Laser Scanning). Consequently, applications of SfM-MVS in physical geography have multiplied rapidly. There are many practical options available to physical geographers when planning a SfM-MVS survey (e.g. platforms, cameras, software), yet, many SfM-MVS end-users are uncertain as to the errors associated with each choice and, perhaps most fundamentally, the processes actually taking place as part of the SfM-MVS workflow. This paper details the typical workflow applied by SfM-MVS software packages, reviews practical details of implementing SfM-MVS, combines existing validation studies to assess practically achievable data quality and reviews the range of applications of SfM-MVS in physical geography. The flexibility of the SfM-MVS approach complicates attempts to validate SfM-MVS robustly as each individual validation study will use a different approach (e.g. platform, camera, georeferencing method, etc.). We highlight the need for greater transparency in SfM-MVS processing and enhanced ability to adjust parameters that determine survey quality. Looking forwards, future prospects of SfM-MVS in physical geography are identified through discussion of more recent developments in the fields of image analysis and computer vision.",

The Bathonian-Kimmeridgian Agardhfjellet Member was deposited in an open shelf environment during a transgressive phase, and is characterized by more stagnant conditions than the Berriasian-Hauterivian Rurikfjellet Member. Total organic carbon values range from 1 to 4%, exhibiting a maximum of 12% in the Callovian paper shales. The Rurikfjellet Member, slightly enriched in volcanogenic components compared to the Agardhfjellet Member, displays regressive shelf sedimentation, ending in prodeltaic to deltafront depositional environments. Based on the sedimentpetrographical analyses, each member is divided into minor regressive and transgressive phases, probably reflecting tectonic activity and/or eustatic sea-level variations.",

The subgroup comprises a lower Agardhf jellet (Upper Bathonian - Berriasian) and an upper Rurikf jellet (Berriasian - Hauterivian) formation. Based on field work in central Spitsbergen the following subdivisions of the formations are proposed (units listed in ascending order). The Agardhf jellet Formation (up to 290 m thick) contains four members: Oppdalen - a fining upwards succession from conglomerates to shales; Lardyfjellet - black paper shales; Oppdalsata - grey shales with siltstones and sandstones; and Slottsmøya - grey shales and black paper shales. Within the Oppdalen Member three beds are recognised: Brentskardhaugen - phosphoritic conglomerate; Marhøgda - glauconitic sandstones', and Drønbreen - siltstones and shales. The Rurikfjellet Formation (thickness up to 226 m) is composed of two members: Wimanfjellet - grey and partly silty shale sequence, containing the Myklegardfjellet Bed (of plastic clays) at its base; and Ullaberget - silty and sandy shales with siltstones and sandstones.",

Zr/Rb ratios can be interpreted to indicate grain size variations, while (Zr+Rb)/Sr values reflect variations in the siliciclastic versus carbonate contents. The Th/U ratio can be applied as an indicator of the redox conditions. In 3D plots such as presented here, the interplay between these geochemical factors can be interpreted in terms of the sedimentological evolution of the depositional basin. The geochemical facies analyses show that similar depositional conditions existed on the Jurassic shelf in the two studied localities. The succeeding prodeltaic Cretaceous beds were generally coarser grained and deposited in ventilated depositional conditions.",

		"abstract": "A 200,000-yr interval of extreme global warming marked the start of the Eocene epoch about 55 million years ago. Negative carbon- and oxygen-isotope excursions in marine and terrestrial sediments show that this event was linked to a massive and rapid (∼10,000 yr) input of isotopically depleted carbon1,2. It has been suggested previously that extensive melting of gas hydrates buried in marine sediments may represent the carbon source3,4 and has caused the global climate change. Large-scale hydrate melting, however, requires a hitherto unknown triggering mechanism. Here we present evidence for the presence of thousands of hydrothermal vent complexes identified on seismic reflection profiles from the Vøring and Møre basins in the Norwegian Sea. We propose that intrusion of voluminous mantle-derived melts in carbon-rich sedimentary strata in the northeast Atlantic may have caused an explosive release of methane—transported to the ocean or atmosphere through the vent complexes—close to the Palaeocene/Eocene boundary. Similar volcanic and metamorphic processes may explain climate events associated with other large igneous provinces such as the Siberian Traps (∼250 million years ago) and the Karoo Igneous Province (∼183 million years ago).",

		"abstract": "The magmatic activity (0–16 Ma) in Iceland is linked to a deep mantle plume that has been active for the past 62 My. Icelandic and northeast Atlantic basalts contain variable proportions of two enriched components, interpreted as recycled oceanic crust supplied by the plume, and subcontinental lithospheric mantle derived from the nearby continental margins. A restricted area in southeast Iceland—and especially the Öræfajökull volcano—is characterized by a unique enriched-mantle component (EM2-like) with elevated 87Sr/86Sr and 207Pb/204Pb. Here, we demonstrate through modeling of Sr–Nd–Pb abundances and isotope ratios that the primitive Öræfajökull melts could have assimilated 2–6% of underlying continental crust before differentiating to more evolved melts. From inversion of gravity anomaly data (crustal thickness), analysis of regional magnetic data, and plate reconstructions, we propose that continental crust beneath southeast Iceland is part of ∼350-km-long and 70-km-wide extension of the Jan Mayen Microcontinent (JMM). The extended JMM was marginal to East Greenland but detached in the Early Eocene (between 52 and 47 Mya); by the Oligocene (27 Mya), all parts of the JMM permanently became part of the Eurasian plate following a westward ridge jump in the direction of the Iceland plume.",

		"abstract": "The breakup of Laurasia to form the Northeast Atlantic Realm disintegrated an inhomogeneous collage of cratons sutured by cross-cutting orogens. Volcanic rifted margins formed that are underlain by magma-inflated, extended continental crust. North of the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge a new rift–the Aegir Ridge–propagated south along the Caledonian suture. South of the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge the proto-Reykjanes Ridge propagated north through the North Atlantic Craton along an axis displaced ~150 km to the west of the rift to the north. Both propagators stalled where the confluence of the Nagssugtoqidian and Caledonian orogens formed an ~300-km-wide transverse barrier. Thereafter, the ~150 × 300-km block of continental crust between the rift tips–the Iceland Microcontinent–extended in a distributed, unstable manner along multiple axes of extension. These axes repeatedly migrated or jumped laterally with shearing occurring between them in diffuse transfer zones. This style of deformation continues to the present day in Iceland. It is the surface expression of underlying magma-assisted stretching of ductile continental crust that has flowed from the Iceland Microplate and flanking continental areas to form the lower crust of the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge. Icelandic-type crust which underlies the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge is thus not anomalously thick oceanic crust as is often assumed. Upper Icelandic-type crust comprises magma flows and dykes. Lower Icelandic-type crust comprises magma-inflated continental mid- and lower crust. Contemporary magma production in Iceland, equivalent to oceanic layers 2–3, corresponds to Icelandic-type upper crust plus intrusions in the lower crust, and has a total thickness of only 10–15 km. This is much less than the total maximum thickness of 42 km for Icelandic-type crust measured seismically in Iceland. The feasibility of the structure we propose is confirmed by numerical modeling that shows extension of the continental crust can continue for many tens of millions of years by lower-crustal ductile flow. A composition of Icelandic-type lower crust that is largely continental can account for multiple seismic observations along with gravity, bathymetric, topographic, petrological and geochemical data that are inconsistent with a gabbroic composition for Icelandic-type lower crust. It also offers a solution to difficulties in numerical models for melt-production by downward-revising the amount of melt needed. Unstable tectonics on the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge can account for long-term tectonic disequilibrium on the adjacent rifted margins, the southerly migrating rift propagators that build diachronous chevron ridges of thick crust about the Reykjanes Ridge, and the tectonic decoupling of the oceans to the north and south. A model of complex, discontinuous continental breakup influenced by crustal inhomogeneity that distributes continental material in growing oceans fits other regions including the Davis Strait, the South Atlantic and the West Indian Ocean.",

Temporally, these picrites erupted just prior to, and coeval with, the initiation of sea-floor spreading in Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay. Petrogenetically, the chemical characteristics of these picrites (MgO = 18–21 wt%; K2O = 0.01–0.20 wt%; 87Sr/86Sri ≈ 0.7030; εNdi ≈ +5.2–8.6; 3He/4He ≤ 49.5RA) are those of D-MORBs that demand derivation only by partial melting of highly incompatible-element depleted subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) at a pressure of ~ 4 GPa, followed by rapid ascent to the surface, but do not necessarily require high temperatures or high degrees of partial melting. Tectonically, these picrites formed near Paleoproterozoic suture zones in the SCLM of thick Paleoproterozoic cratonic terranes during Paleogene rifting between Greenland and North America. Structurally, the picrites are related to the major intersection of a NNW-trending lithospheric thinning under Baffin Bay and the ~E-W-trending thickened lithosphere of the Paleoproterozoic Nagssugtoqidian Fold Belt. During the late Mesozoic, ENE extension that thinned the mantle lithosphere and created normal-faulted basins. Elastic finite-element models and present-day studies of crustal extension show that the thicker Nagssugtoqidian Fold Belt underwent less thinning and extension than the Baffin Bay lithosphere. These extensional disparities occurred at the orthogonal intersection of pre-existing ~E-W-trending strike-slip faults in the thicker Nagssugtoqidian Fold Belt with the incipient spreading under Baffin Bay, and likely resulted in the formation of one or more pull-apart basins. Because the strike-slip faults are ancient suture zones, trans-tension within these suture zones easily reached depths of ~120 km, not only creating adiabatic decompression melting in the SCLM, but also forming an open pathway for the picritic melts to rapidly reach the surface. This purely tectonic model requires no spatially or temporally improbable deep mantle plume for generation of the Paleocene picrites of Davis Strait.",

		"abstract": "We have re-evaluated mantle potential temperature estimates for the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP). Temperature estimates involving olivine addition to pillow-lava glasses are unreliable because host glasses formed along the liquid+olivine+plagioclase cotectic and not just the olivine liquidus. Additionally, magma chamber processes can generate picritic lavas containing only magnesian olivine, but picrites alone do not require high mantle temperatures. Furthermore, petrological models tend to over-estimate TP in picrites containing appreciable accumulative olivine further confusing the issue. Selected aphyric lavas from West Greenland, which cannot have accumulated olivine, suggest maximum TP~1500 °C. Petrological models for Icelandic glasses suggest a maximum TP~1450 °C which is consistent with olivine-melt and olivine-spinel equilibration temperatures. However, melting of ‘damp’ peridotite beneath Iceland would reduce this estimate perhaps by 50 °C. The NAIP mantle was lithologically and chemically heterogeneous and was made of a hybrid pyroxenite-peridotite lithology, the pyroxenite component being derived from recycling of subducted slabs. However, there is no necessity for the subducted slabs to have been recycled to the core-mantle boundary. Pyroxenite could have been derived from Caledonian-aged slabs that also hosted helium with high 3He/4He within the shallow mantle, which was inherited by Palaeocene or young melts. The pyroxenite component was more readily fusible than the peridotite component under the same P-T conditions, allowing variations in melt production rate throughout the province. Melting of lithologically variable mantle is consistent with observed radiogenic isotope variability in Icelandic basalts and related trace-element variations in throughout the NAIP. We propose that magmatism in the NAIP resulted from extensional tectonics above ‘warm’ mantle that had been internally heated beneath thick continental lithosphere prior to continental break up. Only in areas of extension did magmatism occur, thus explaining the apparently widespread initial phase of magmatic activity.",

		"abstract": "The Norwegian-Greenland Sea (NGS) in the NE Atlantic comprises diverse tectonic regimes and structural features including sub-oceanic basins of different ages, microcontinents and conjugate volcanic passive margins, between the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge in the south and the Arctic Ocean in the north. We summarize the tectonic evolution of the area and highlight the complexity of the conjugate volcanic and rifted margins up to lithospheric rupture in the NGS. The highly magmatic breakup in the NGS was diachronous and initiated as isolated and segmented seafloor spreading centres. The early seafloor spreading system, initiating in the Early Eocene, gradually developed into atypical propagating systems with subsequent breakup(s) following a step-by-step thinning and rupture of the lithosphere. Newly-formed spreading axes propagated initially towards local Euler poles, died out, migrated or jumped laterally, changed their propagating orientation or eventually bifurcated. With the Palaeocene onset of volcanic rifting, breakup-related intrusions may have localized deformation and guided the final axis of breakup along distal regions already affected by pre-magmatic Late Cretaceous-Palaeocene and older extensional phases. The final line of lithospheric breakup may have been controlled by highly oblique extension, associated plate shearing and/or melt intrusions before and during Seaward Dipping Reflectors (SDRs) formation. The Inner SDRs and accompanying volcanics formed preferentially either on thick continental ribbons and/or moderately thinned continental crust. The segmented and diachronic evolution of the NGS spreading activity is also reflected by a time delay of 1–2 Myrs expected between the emplacement of the SDRs imaged at the Møre and Vøring margins. This complex evolution was followed by several prominent changes in spreading kinematics, the first occurring in the Middle Eocene at 47 Ma–magnetic chron C21r. Inheritance and magmatism likely influenced the complex rift reorganization resulting in the final dislocation of the Jan Mayen Microplate Complex from Greenland, in the Late Oligocene/Early Miocene.",

Several Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) formed, such as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP). Here, we review the chronology of Pangaea breakup and related large-scale magmatism. We review the Triassic formation of the Central Atlantic Ocean, the breakup between East and West Gondwana in the Middle Jurassic, the Early Cretaceous opening of the South Atlantic, the Cretaceous separation of India from Antarctica, and finally the formation of the North Atlantic in the Mesozoic-Cenozoic. We demonstrate that throughout the dispersal of Pangaea, major volcanism typically occurs distal from the locus of rift initiation and initial oceanic crust accretion. There is no location where extension propagates away from a newly formed LIP. Instead, LIPs are coincident with major lithosphere-scale shear movements, aborted rifts and splinters of continental crust rifted far out into the oceanic domain. These observations suggest that a fundamental reappraisal of the causes and consequences of breakup-related LIPs is in order.",

		"abstract": "The Reykjanes Ridge is a key setting to study plate boundary processes overlaid on a regional mantle melting anomaly. The ridge originated as one arm of a ridge-ridge-ridge triple junction that separated Greenland, Eurasia, and North America. It initially formed a linear axis, spreading orthogonally at slow rates without transform faults or orthogonal crustal segmentation. Stable spreading continued in this configuration for ∼18 Myr until Labrador Sea spreading ceased, terminating the triple junction by joining Greenland to North America and causing a rapid ∼30° change in opening direction across the ridge. The ridge abruptly became segmented and offset by a series of transform faults that appear to decrease in length and spacing toward Iceland. Without further changes in opening direction, the ridge promptly began to reassemble its original linear configuration systematically and diachronously from north to south, even though this required the ridge to spread obliquely as it became linear again. Prominent V-shaped crustal ridges spread outward from the axis as the ridge became linear. This reconfiguration is presently nearly complete from Iceland to the Bight transform fault, a distance of nearly 1000km. Both mantle plume and plate boundary processes have been proposed to control the tectonic reconfigurations and crustal accretion characteristics of the Reykjanes Ridge. Here we review the ridge characteristics and tectonic evolution and various models proposed to influence them.",

		"abstract": "The North Atlantic, extending from the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone to the north Norway-Greenland-Svalbard margins, is regarded as both a classic case of structural inheritance and an exemplar for the Wilson-cycle concept. This paper examines different aspects of structural inheritance in the Circum-North Atlantic region: 1) as a function of rejuvenation from lithospheric to crustal scales, and 2) in terms of sequential rifting and opening of the ocean and its margins, including a series of failed rift systems. We summarise and evaluate the role of fundamental lithospheric structures such as mantle fabric and composition, lower crustal inhomogeneities, orogenic belts, and major strike-slip faults during breakup. We relate these to the development and shaping of the NE Atlantic rifted margins, localisation of magmatism, and microcontinent release. We show that, although inheritance is common on multiple scales, the Wilson Cycle is at best an imperfect model for the Circum-North Atlantic region. Observations from the NE Atlantic suggest depth dependency in inheritance (surface, crust, mantle) with selective rejuvenation depending on time-scales, stress field orientations and thermal regime. Specifically, post-Caledonian reactivation to form the North Atlantic rift systems essentially followed pre-existing orogenic crustal structures, while eventual breakup reflected a change in stress field and exploitation of a deeper-seated, lithospheric-scale shear fabrics. We infer that, although collapse of an orogenic belt and eventual transition to a new ocean does occur, it is by no means inevitable.",

		"abstract": "The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), alternatively \"Eocene thermal maximum 1\" (ETM1), and formerly known as the \"Initial Eocene\" or \"Late Paleocene Thermal Maximum\", was a time period with a more than 5–8 °C global average temperature rise across the event. This climate event occurred at the time boundary of the Paleocene and Eocene geological epochs. The exact age and duration of the event is uncertain but it is estimated to have occurred around 55.5 million years ago.The associated period of massive carbon release into the atmosphere has been estimated to have lasted from 20,000 to 50,000 years. The entire warm period lasted for about 200,000 years. Global temperatures increased by 5–8 °C.The onset of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum has been linked to volcanism and uplift associated with the North Atlantic Igneous Province, causing extreme changes in Earth's carbon cycle and a significant temperature rise. The period is marked by a prominent negative excursion in carbon stable isotope (δ13C) records from around the globe; more specifically, there was a large decrease in 13C/12C ratio of marine and terrestrial carbonates and organic carbon. Paired δ13C, δ11B, and δ18O data suggest that ~12000 Gt of carbon (at least 44000 Gt CO2e) were released over 50,000 years, averaging 0.24 Gt per year.\nStratigraphic sections of rock from this period reveal numerous other changes. Fossil records for many organisms show major turnovers. For example, in the marine realm, a mass extinction of benthic foraminifera, a global expansion of subtropical dinoflagellates, and an appearance of excursion, planktic foraminifera and calcareous nanofossils all occurred during the beginning stages of PETM. On land, modern mammal orders (including primates) suddenly appear in Europe and in North America. Sediment deposition changed significantly at many outcrops and in many drill cores spanning this time interval.\nSince at least 1997, the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum has been investigated in geoscience as an analog to understand the effects of global warming and of massive carbon inputs to the ocean and atmosphere, including ocean acidification. Humans today emit about 10 Gt of carbon (about 37 Gt CO2e) per year, and will have released a comparable amount in about 1,000 years at that rate. A main difference is that during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, the planet was ice-free, as the Drake Passage had not yet opened and the Central American Seaway had not yet closed. Although the PETM is now commonly held to be a \"case study\" for global warming and massive carbon emission, the cause, details, and overall significance of the event remain uncertain.",

		"abstract": "The NE Atlantic margin is one of the last frontier areas of hydrocarbon exploration within the UK Continental Shelf. In 2004, a major oil and gas discovery (Rosebank) was made within Paleocene–Eocene-age lavas in the Faroe–Shetland Basin. The Rosebank Field consists of intra-basaltic terrestrial to marginal-marine reservoir sequences, separated by basaltic lava flows and volcaniclastics. Despite the identification of a major intra-lava-incised drainage system running parallel to the SW–NE-trending Rosebank Field, the controls on the distribution of both the volcanics and the intra-basaltic sediments were previously unclear, in part due to the difficulties that volcanic sequences pose to seismic acquisition, processing and interpretation. This has led to uncertainty in defining the wider intra-basaltic play. However, the examination of the recently acquired FSB 2011–12 MultiClient GeoStreamer® Survey has facilitated an increased definition of the geological units within and below the volcanic succession, and a reinterpretation of the Late Paleocene–Early Eocene stratigraphy. Through integration of 3D seismic data and well analysis, we present a regional overview of the volcanics and intra-basaltic sediments in the Rosebank region of the Faroe–Shetland Basin. We find that the structural setting of the Rosebank Field, in addition to lava-flow morphology, strongly influences the distribution of the intra-basaltic play fairway within the Paleocene–Eocene-aged Flett Formation. Restriction of fluvial siliciclastic sediments adjacent to the Corona Ridge extends the theorized Rosebank play fairway to the area SW of the Rosebank Field. Our analysis indicates that understanding the underlying basin structure is integral to the success of intra-basaltic plays.",

		"abstract": "Aerial image capture has become very common within the geosciences due to the increasing affordability of low-payload (<20 kg) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for consumer markets. Their application to surveying has subsequently led to many studies being undertaken using UAV imagery and derived products as primary data sources. However, image quality and the principles of image capture are seldom given rigorous discussion. In this contribution we firstly revisit the underpinning concepts behind image capture, from which the requirements for acquiring sharp, well-exposed and suitable image data are derived. Secondly, the platform, camera, lens and imaging settings relevant to image quality planning are discussed, with worked examples to guide users through the process of considering the factors required for capturing high-quality imagery for geoscience investigations., Given a target feature size and ground sample distance based on mission objectives, the flight height and velocity should be calculated to ensure motion blur is kept to a minimum. We recommend using a camera with as large a sensor as is permissible for the aerial platform being used (to maximise sensor sensitivity), effective focal lengths of 24–35 mm (to minimise errors due to lens distortion) and optimising ISO (to ensure the shutter speed is fast enough to minimise motion blur). Finally, we give recommendations for the reporting of results by researchers in order to help improve the confidence in, and reusability of, surveys through providing open access imagery where possible, presenting example images and excerpts and detailing appropriate metadata to rigorously describe the image capture process.",

		"abstract": "Skip to Next Section\nExtract\nThe Norwegian passive continental margin extends some 1100 km along-strike, from the UK border in the SW to the Senja Fracture Zone in the NE. The margin can be divided into three segments. The Møre segment in the south is a relatively simple, deep and broad Cretaceous basin close to the Norwegian mainland. The middle part is the Vøring/Haltenbanken segment, a broad (400 km) and complex margin with a platform area (Trøndelag Platform), terraces (Halten and Dønna Terrace) and the deep, broad, Cretaceous/Early Tertiary Vøring Basin on the seaward side. The northern part is the Lofoten/Vesterålen segment, where the peninsular Lofoten islands form a high, uplifted and narrow horst between the steep and structured Tertiary margin to the west, and the deep Vestfjord Basin of assumed Cretaceous age to the east.\nThe development into passive continental margin segments occurred during the opening of the NE Atlantic in the earliest Eocene. The break-up was associated with massive volcanic activity and in particular the Møre and Vøring segments form type examples of volcanic passive margins. The area had a very long history of extensional tectonics and rifting before the final successful opening. Extensional tectonics dominate, both as deep basement-involved faulting, and as more shallow listric faults locally detaching into Triassic evaporite layers; inversion and doming are also seen. In terms of extensional deformation the three segments developed differently, creating a variety of structural features. Across the broadest segment, the Vøring Margin, an apparent lateral migration of rifting events exposes a development from at least Permian time.",

This is thanks, above all, to their flexibility of use and low cost compared to traditional photogrammetric flights using expensive metric digital cameras or LiDAR sensors. In recent years, UAVs have also been used in the field of monitoring and inspection of public or private buildings that are remarkable in terms of size and architecture. This is mainly due to the focus a sustainability and resource efficiency in the building and infrastructure sector, which aims to extend their lifetimes. Through the use of remote checking using UAVs, the monitoring and inspection of buildings can be brought to a new level of quality and saving.</p><p> This paper focuses on the processing and study of 3D models obtained from images captured by an UAV. In particular, the authors wanted to study the accuracy gains achieved in the building 3D model obtained with both nadir and oblique UAV flights. The images from the flights were processed using Structure-for Motion-based approach for point cloud generation using dense image-matching algorithms implemented in an open source software. We used the open source software VisualSfM, developed by Chanchang Wu in collaboration with the University of Washington and Google. The dense matching plug-in integrated in its interface, PMVS/CMVS, made by Yasutaka Furukawa, was employed to generate the dense cloud. The achieved results were compare with those gained by Photoscan software by Agisoft and with 3D model from the Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) survey.</p>",

		"abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Erosion and deposition processes in badland areas are usually estimated using traditional observations of topographic changes, measured by erosion pins or profile metres (invasive techniques). In recent times, remote-sensing techniques (non-invasive) have been routinely applied in geomorphology studies, especially in erosion studies. These techniques provide the opportunity to build high-resolution topographic models at centimetre accuracy. By comparing different 3-D point clouds of the same area, obtained at different time intervals, the variations in the terrain and temporal dynamics can be analysed. The aim of this study is to assess and compare the functioning of terrestrial laser scanner (TLS, RIEGL LPM-321) and structure-from-motion photogrammetry (SfM) techniques (Camera FUJIFILM, Finepix x100 and software PhotoScan by AgiSoft) to evaluate erosion and deposition processes in two opposite slopes in a humid badlands area in the central Spanish Pyrenees. Results showed that TLS data sets and SfM photogrammetry techniques provide new opportunities in geomorphological erosion studies. The data we recorded over 1 year demonstrated that north-facing slopes experienced more intense and faster changing geomorphological dynamics than south-facing slopes as well as the highest erosion rates. Different seasonal processes were observed, with the highest topographic differences observed during winter periods and the high-intensity rainfalls in summer. While TLS provided the highest accuracy models, SfM photogrammetry was still a faster methodology in the field and precise at short distances. Both techniques present advantages and disadvantages, and do not require direct contact with the soil and thus prevent the usual surface disturbance of traditional and invasive methods.</p>",

Up to date, there has not been any study clearly comparing different algorithms for filtering of vegetation. The objective in this study was, therefore, to assess the performance of various vegetation filter algorithms for SfM-obtained point clouds. The comparison was done for a Mediterranean area in Murcia, Spain with heterogeneous vegetation cover. The filter methods that were compared were: color-based filtering using an excessive greenness vegetation index (VI), Triangulated Irregular Networks (TIN) densification from LAStools, the standard method in Agisoft Photoscan (PS), iterative surface lowering (ISL), and a combination of iterative surface lowering and the VI method (ISL_VI). Results showed that for bare areas there was little to no difference between the filtering methods, which is to be expected because there is little to no vegetation present to filter. For areas with shrubs and trees, the ISL_VI and TIN method performed best. These results show that different filtering techniques have various degrees of success in different use cases. A default filter in commercial software such as Photoscan may not always be the best way to remove unwanted vegetation from a point cloud, but instead alternative methods such as a TIN densification algorithm should be used to obtain a vegetation-less Digital Terrain Model (DTM).",

		"abstract": "Large amounts of methane are trapped as natural gas hydrate (NGH) in the sediments of the Arctic. Unlike NGH provinces offshore west of Svalbard (Vestnesa Ridge), NGH potential in Svalbard’s fjords and near-shore environment is poorly constrained. In this study we modelled the NGH stability zone (GHSZ) to determine the NGH formation potential within the fjords of Svalbard. We applied a nearest neighbour interpolation method to dynamically derive statistical bottom-water temperature (BWT) trends from available CTD data. The BWT trends along with available geothermal gradient data constrained Svalbard-wide sub-bottom thermobaric models suitable for GHSZ modelling in the near subsurface. Analyses of source rock and fluid seepage data in Isfjorden, including 15 newly identified acoustic gas flares, indicate an active petroleum system with fluid migration reaching the seafloor with significant contributions of higher-order hydrocarbons to the gas feed. A GHSZ is predicted for most fjords at mean BWT conditions and 95:5 methane:ethane gas compositions. Suitable conditions for pure methane NGH formation are only met in the deepest parts of Isfjorden, Hinlopenstretet, Kross- and Kongsfjorden, and Rijpfjorden. Temporal constraints implemented along the well-defined Isfjorden transect indicated a notable negative response to water column warming. The predicted GHSZ across Svalbard’s fjords is likely to disappear over the next few decades.",

		"abstract": "Applications of unmanned aerial systems for forest monitoring are increasing and drive a need to understand how image processing workflows impact end-user products’ accuracy from tree detection methods. Increasing image overlap and making acquisitions at lower altitudes improve how structure from motion point clouds represents forest canopies. However, only limited testing has evaluated how image resolution and point cloud filtering impact the detection of individual tree locations and heights. We evaluate how Agisoft Metashape’s build dense cloud Quality (image resolution) and depth map filter settings influence tree detection from canopy height models in ponderosa pine forests. Finer resolution imagery with minimal filtering provided the best visual representation of vegetation detail for trees of all sizes. These same settings maximized tree detection F-score at &gt;0.72 for overstory (&gt;7 m tall) and &gt;0.60 for understory trees. Additionally, overstory tree height bias and precision improve as image resolution becomes finer. Overstory and understory tree detection in open-canopy conifer systems might be optimized using the finest resolution imagery that computer hardware enables, while applying minimal point cloud filtering. The extended processing time and data storage demands of high-resolution imagery must be balanced against small reductions in tree detection performance when down-scaling image resolution to allow the processing of greater data extents.",

		"abstract": "The use of consumer grade unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is becoming more and more ubiquitous in photogrammetric applications. A large proportion of consumer grade UAVs are equipped with CMOS image sensor and rolling shutter. When imaging with a rolling shutter camera, the image sensor is exposed line by line, which can introduce additional distortions in image space since the UAV navigates at a relatively high speed during aerial acquisitions. In this paper, we propose (1) an approach to calibrate the readout time of rolling shutter camera, (2) a two-step method to correct the image distortion introduced by this effect. The two-step method makes assumption that during exposure, the change of camera orientation is negligible with respect to the change of camera position, which is often the case when camera is fixed on a stabilized mount. Firstly, the camera velocity is estimated from the results of an initial bundle block adjustment; then, one camera pose per scan-line of the image sensor is recovered and image observations are corrected. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, four datasets of block and corridor configurations are acquired with the DJI Mavic 2 Pro and its original Hasselbald L1D-20c camera. The proposed method is implemented in MicMac, a free, open-source photogrammetric software; comparisons are carried out with other two mainstream software, AgiSoft MetaShape and Pix4D, which also have the functionality of rolling shutter effect correction. For block configuration datasets, the three software give comparable results. AgiSoft Metashape and Pix4D are sensitive to the flight configuration and encounter difficulties when processing datasets in corridor configurations. The proposed method shows good robustness both in block and corridor configurations, and is the only method that works in corridor configuration. After the application of the rolling shutter effect correction, the 3D accuracy is improved by 30–60% in block configuration and 15–25% in corridor configuration. A further improvement can be expected if a precise dating of image is available or if the camera positions can be directly extracted from GNSS data.",

The aim of this study was to determined how many GCPs and what kind of distribution is required in order to obtain high precision results. In the study, three scenarios were investigated. The GCPs were tested in edge distribution in the first scenario, in the middle distribution in the second scenario, and in homogeneous distribution in the third scenario. In the first scenario, the edge distribution was supported by the central GCPs, while in the second scenario, the central GCPs were supported by the edge GCPs. Each scenario was initiated with four GCPs. The number of GCPs was increased by four, resulting in the utilization of a total of 35 GCPs. In addition, 30 check points (CHP) were used. The number of orthophoto and DSM produced in the study was 33. In the study, the best planimetric accuracy was obtained with the first scenario, namely with the edge distribution (RMSE xy: 0.033 m). Altimetric accuracy was obtained with the third scenario, namely with homogeneous distribution (RMSE z: 0.048 m).",

		"abstract": "Carbonates represent major hydrocarbon reservoirs, but often exhibit highly heterogeneous reservoir properties. Outcrop analogues provide important insights into how parameters such as porosity, permeability and natural fractures vary. As such, outcrops can bridge the scale gap between spatially extensive but poor-resolution seismic data and 1D high-resolution well data. However, traditional geological fieldwork typically gathers insufficient data to construct robust geological models. In this study, we have specifically set out to gather key data sets that enable the construction of a geology-driven model. We illustrate this workflow using the exceptionally well-exposed carbonate-dominated outcrops of the Kapp Starostin Formation in central Spitsbergen, Arctic Norway. We fully utilize emerging technologies, notably geo-referenced digital outcrop models (DOMs), to be able to gather quantitative sedimentological-structural data from otherwise inaccessible cliffs. DOMs generated from digital photos are used directly for automatic and manual mapping of fractures. The digital data are complemented with traditional fieldwork (sedimentological logging, scanlines, structural characterization) in order to strengthen the dataset. The geo-modelling involves traditional facies and petrophysical modelling of the 12 identified facies, along with outcrop-based discrete fracture modelling. Finally, the static geo-model is upscaled, and its applications are discussed. The presented workflow uses carbonate outcrops of the Kapp Starostin Formation as input but is highly applicable for other studies where outcrops can be utilized as direct input to constrain a geological model.",

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT The effect of sub‐core scale heterogeneity on fluid distribution pattern, and the electrical and acoustic properties of a typical reservoir rock was studied by performing drainage and imbibition flooding tests with CO2 and brine in a laboratory. Moderately layered Rothbach sandstone was used as a test specimen. Two core samples were drilled; one perpendicular and the other parallel to the layering to allow injection of fluids along and normal to the bedding plane. During the test 3D images of fluid distribution and saturation levels were mapped by an industrial X‐ray CT‐scanner together with simultaneous measurement of electrical resistivity, ultrasonic velocities as well as amplitudes. The results showed how the layering and the flooding direction influenced the fluid distribution pattern and the saturation level of the fluids. For a given fluid saturation level, the measured changes in the acoustic and electrical parameters were affected by both the fluid distribution pattern and the layering orientation relative to the measurement direction. The P‐wave amplitude and the electrical resistivity were more sensitive to small changes in the fluid distribution patterns than the P‐wave velocity. The change in amplitude was the most affected by the orientation of the layering and the resulting fluid distribution patterns. In some instances the change due to the fluid distribution pattern was higher than the variation caused by the change in CO2 saturation. As a result the Gassmann relation based on ‘uniform&apos; or ‘patchy&apos; saturation pattern was not suitable to predict the P‐wave velocity variation. Overall, the results demonstrate the importance of core‐imaging to improve our understanding of fluid distribution patterns and the associated effects on measured rock‐physics properties.",

In spite of 40 y of research into this phenomenon, it is still unknown how excess magmatism is produced and what controls its surprisingly short duration. Expedition 396 will revisit the mid-Norwegian margin 36 y after Ocean Drilling Program Leg 104. It will provide the necessary observations to parameterize comprehensive 3-D numerical models. These will allow us to identify the relative importance of different tectonomagmatic processes. Furthermore, drilling will test the predictions of volcanic seismic facies models and elucidate the role of breakup volcanism in rapid global warming. Secondary objectives relate to the onset of the meridional overturning circulation in the North Atlantic Gateway and the potential to use the breakup basalt province to store carbon dioxide on industrial scales. To this end, Expedition 396 will attempt to drill nine boreholes on the Vøring and Møre margins. They will target the breakup volcanic successions as well as the overlying postrift sediments and the underlying synrift sediments. In conjunction with the wealth of reflection seismic data collected by the hydrocarbon industry during the past 40 y, the new borehole information will provide an unprecedented picture of the formation of a large igneous province during the opening of an ocean basin.",

		"abstract": "Continental collision causes deformation in the crust along shear zones. However, the physical and chemical conditions at which these zones operate and the deformation processes that enable up to hundreds of km of tectonic transport are still unclear because of the depth at which they occur and the challenges in imaging them. Ancient exhumed collision zones allow us to investigate these processes much better, for example at the COSC-1 borehole in the central Scandinavian Caledonides. This study combines data from the COSC-1 borehole with different seismic measurements to provide constraints on the spatial lithological and textural configuration of the Seve Nappe Complex. This is one of the few studies that shows that core-log-seismic integration in metamorphic rocks allows to identify the spatial distribution of major lithological units. Especially gamma ray logs in combination with density data are powerful tools to distinguish between mafic and felsic lithologies in log-core correlation. Our results indicate that reflections along the borehole are primarily caused by compositional rather than textural changes. Reflections in the Seve Nappe Complex are not as distinct as in greater depths but continuous and several of them can be linked to magmatic intrusions, which have been metamorphically overprinted. Their setting indicates that the Seve Nappe Complex consists of the remnants of a volcanic continental margin. Our results suggest that ductile-deformed middle crustal reflectivity is primarily a function of pre-orogenic lithological variations which has to be considered when deciphering mountain building processes.",

The distribution of the associated extrusive rocks derived from seismic volcanostratigraphy and potential field data interpretation allows us to divide the Møre, Vøring and Lofoten–Vesterålen margins into five segments. The central Møre Margin and the northern Vøring Margin show combinations of volcanic seismic facies units that are characteristic for typical rifted volcanic margins. The Lofoten–Vesterålen Margin, the southern Vøring Margin and the area near the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone show volcanic seismic facies units that are related to small-volume, submarine volcanism. The distribution of subaerial and submarine deposits indicates variations of subsidence along the margin. Vertical movements on the mid-Norwegian margin were primarily controlled by the amount of magmatic crustal thickening, because both the amount of dynamic uplift by the Icelandic mantle plume and the amount of subsidence due to crustal stretching were fairly constant along the margin. Thus, subaerial deposits indicate a large amount of magmatic crustal thickening and an associated reduction in isostatic subsidence, whereas submarine deposits indicate little magmatic thickening and earlier subsidence. From the distribution of volcanic seismic facies units we infer two main reasons for the different amounts of crustal thickening: (1) a general northward decrease of magmatism due to increasing distance from the hot spot and (2) subdued volcanism near the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone as a result of lateral lithospheric heat transport and cooling of the magmatic source region. Furthermore, we interpret small lateral variations in the distribution of volcanic seismic facies units, such as two sets of Inner Seaward Dipping Reflectors on the central Vøring Margin, as indications of crustal fragmentation.",

Given the limited data and the resulting necessity for geological interpretation to construct these geomodels, uncertainty is pervasive and traditionally unquantified. Probabilistic geomodeling allows for the simulation of uncertainties by automatically constructing geomodel ensembles from perturbed input data sampled from probability distributions. But random sampling of input parameters can lead to construction of geomodels that are unrealistic, either due to modeling artifacts or by not matching known information about the regional geology of the modeled system. We present a method to incorporate geological information in the form of known geomodel topology into stochastic simulations to constrain resulting probabilistic geomodel ensembles using the open-source geomodeling software GemPy. Simulated geomodel realizations are checked against topology information using an approximate Bayesian computation approach to avoid the specification of a likelihood function. We demonstrate how we can infer the posterior distributions of the model parameters using topology information in two experiments: (1) a synthetic geomodel using a rejection sampling scheme (ABC-REJ) to demonstrate the approach and (2) a geomodel of a subset of the Gullfaks field in the North Sea comparing both rejection sampling and a sequential Monte Carlo sampler (ABC-SMC). Possible improvements to processing speed of up to 10.1 times are discussed, focusing on the use of more advanced sampling techniques to avoid the simulation of unfeasible geomodels in the first place. Results demonstrate the feasibility of using topology graphs as a summary statistic to restrict the generation of geomodel ensembles with known geological information and to obtain improved ensembles of probable geomodels which respect the known topology information and exhibit reduced uncertainty using stochastic simulation methods.</p>",

Analogues provide important information on geobody size, geometry and potential connectivity. The historical application of outcrop analogues for understanding geobody distributions in reservoirs is reviewed, from the pioneering work of the 1960s to the high-tech virtual outcrop methodologies of today. Four key types of analogue data are identified: hard data, which describe the dimensions and geometry of the geobody; soft data, which describe the conceptual relationships between different geobody types; training images, which record the dimensions, proportions and spatial relationship; and analogue production data, which are taken from direct subsurface production analogues. The use of these different data types at different stages of the geomodelling workflow is discussed and the potential sources of error considered. Finally, a review of geobody and analogue studies in different clastic environments is discussed with reference to selected previous work and the range of papers in the current volume.",

Since both properties are affected by lithology, pore fluid chemistry, and water content (see Chapter 4 of this volume), these methods have significant potential for hydrogeophysical applications. The methods can be applied at a wide range of laboratory and field scales, and surveys may be made in arbitrary geometrical configurations (e.g., on the soil surface and down boreholes). In fact, resistivity methods are one of the most widely used sets of geophysical techniques in hydrogeophysics. These surveys are relatively easy to carry out, instrumentation is inexpensive, data processing tools are widely available, and the relationships between resistivity and hydrological properties, such as porosity and moisture content, are reasonably well established. In contrast, applications of induced polarization methods in hydrogeophysics have been limited. As noted by Slater and Lesmes (2002), this is partly because of the more complex procedure for data acquisition, but also because the physicochemical interpretation of induced polarization parameters is not fully understood.",

		"abstract": "Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and induced polarization (IP) methods are now widely used in many interdisciplinary projects. Although field surveys using these methods are relatively straightforward, ERT and IP data require the application of inverse methods prior to any interpretation. Several established non-commercial inversion codes exist, but they typically require advanced knowledge to use effectively. ResIPy was developed to provide a more intuitive, user-friendly, approach to inversion of geoelectrical data, using an open source graphical user interface (GUI) and a Python application programming interface (API). ResIPy utilizes the mature R2/cR2 inversion codes for ERT and IP, respectively. The ResIPy GUI facilitates data importing, data filtering, error modeling, mesh generation, data inversion and plotting of inverse models. Furthermore, the easy to use design of ResIPy and the help provided inside makes it an effective educational tool. This paper highlights the rationale and structure behind the interface, before demonstrating its capabilities in a range of environmental problems. Specifically, we demonstrate the ease at which ResIPy deals with topography, advanced data processing, the ability to fix and constrain regions of known geoelectrical properties, time-lapse analysis and the capability for forward modeling and survey design.",

		"abstract": "The NNE-trending Isfjorden-Ymerbukta Fault Zone is an oblique structural element within the NNW-trending Tertiary transpressional fold-thrust belt of Spitsbergen, Arctic Norway. It can be traced for nearly 50 km, and separates two different structural domains in the fold-thrust welt of Oscar II Land, Central Spitsbergen. The fault zone is more than 500 m wide and contains several segments of highly folded/rotated, faulted and cleaved Triassic through Paleocene rocks. Displacement across the fault zone can be decomposed into (i) a reverse, top-to-the-ENE component with a minimum 650 m vertical throw, and (ii) a horizontal dextral component of approximately 5-10 km. Displacement across the fault decreases northward along strike, where the fault zone merges into parallelism with a ramp-system of the fold-thrust belt. Inherited, underlying Devonian(?)-Carboniferous structures may have controlled the location of the fault zone. Detailed studies of map and mesoscale faults and folds reveal complex geometries and varied kinematic signatures across the fault zone width. Along the southwest portion of the fault zone (Ramfjellet-Erdmannflya) three major fault segments record oblique-reverse (Morenekilen fault), combined oblique-reverse and oblique-normal (Straumhallet fault), and dextral strike-slip (Flydammane fault) movements, respectively. Further northeast (Mehøgda-Bohemanflya), a traverse from west to east of three structural domains shows; (1) thrusts and associated folds that record oblique-reverse kinematics, (2) steep faults with dextral strike-slip and conjugate strike-slip (extrusion) movements, and (3) thrusts and oblique-normal faults. The overall kinematics is consistent with mainly oblique-reverse and dextral strike-slip faulting, and subordinate local fault zone-oblique/parallel extension. Various geometries within the fault zone, as well as the variation in the direction of movement on the segments, can be explained from either (i) synchronous shortening and out-of-the-plane movement partitioning, or (ii) an effect of polyphase changes in the orientation of the overall shortening axes during the fold-thrust belt evolution. Either of these interpretations is consistent with the Isfjorden-Ymerbukta Fault Zone as an oblique-thrust ramp or transfer fault.",

		"abstract": "The Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Agardhfjellet and Rurikfjellet formations comprise a 450 m thick shale-dominated succession. This succession is present across central parts of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, and is the targeted caprock for the Longyearbyen CO2 Lab. The focus of this study has been on the Slottsmøya Member of the Agardhfjellet Formation and the Wimanfjellet Member of the Rurikfjellet Formation. Structural measurements collected from two drill cores and two outcrops, located 15 km apart, are the basis of this study. Additionally, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analyses have been conducted on two samples from one of the drill cores. The drill cores exhibit high fracture frequencies, dominated by low-angle shear fractures seen as polished surfaces with slickensides. The outcrops show highly fractured beds, with mainly high-angle open and shear fractures. Mode I and Mode II fractures are interpreted in both drill core and outcrop data. Contractional, meso-scale structures are observed in the field area. The recorded deformation is interpreted to be the result of tectonic events that has affected Spitsbergen after the deposition of the Agardhfjellet and Rurikfjellet formations. These events include the Cretaceous magmatic event which resulted in uplift, Paleogene transpression and Cenozoic deglaciation and erosion. The mineralogy is consistent with a typical shale composition, where clay minerals and quartz constituents show the highest fractions. XRD analyses determine that clay miner- als comprise 35% and 51% of the Agardhfjellet and Rurikfjellet formations, respectively. The study shows that the Agardhfjellet and Rurikfjellet formations are highly fractured, with a de ́collement zone present along the boundary. This is interpreted as the primary reason for the highly deformed rock mass. However, the interval appears to have a good sealing property seen as a vertical pressure difference exists between the targeted reser- voir and caprock succession. The reason for the functional seal is not fully understood, but appears to be related to several factors such as: (i) thickness resulting in satisfying confining pressure, (ii) large amounts of clay minerals, (iii) preferential orientation of existing fractures in relation to current stress regime, (iv) and a décollement zone forming a barrier for vertical fluid flow.",

Almost all these hydrocarbons come from a Jurassic source and the main reservoirs and traps are Jurassic sandstones in fault blocks and Paleocene sandstones or Cretaceous chalks in gentle domes. The article describes four major fields—Ekofisk, Gullfaks, Ormen Lange and Snøhvit— to illustrate some of the many challenges in developing and producing the hydrocarbons. Elsewhere in Norden, there has been much less exploration. Drilling results have mostly been negative in mainland Sweden, onshore Denmark, onshore Sval-bard and on- and offshore West Greenland. Minor oil finds have been made in Palaeozoic rocks in the Baltic Sea. The first wells have recently been drilled off the Faroe Islands, resulting in one discovery. No drilling has taken place on- or offshore East Greenland. As a result of the hydrocarbon activities in Norway and Denmark, petroleum geoscience there has flour-ished, with 2000 geoscientists currently employed in the industry, many technical innovations made, a wealth of publically available information and a great increase in the understanding of the geology.",

A wide range of methods exist to generate geological models. However, the powerful methods are behind a paywall in expensive commercial packages. We present here a full open-source geomodeling method, based on an implicit potential-field interpolation approach. The interpolation algorithm is comparable to implementations in commercial packages and capable of constructing complex full 3-D geological models, including fault networks, fault–surface interactions, unconformities and dome structures. This algorithm is implemented in the programming language Python, making use of a highly efficient underlying library for efficient code generation (<i>Theano</i>) that enables a direct execution on GPUs. The functionality can be separated into the core aspects required to generate 3-D geological models and additional assets for advanced scientific investigations. These assets provide the full power behind our approach, as they enable the link to machine-learning and Bayesian inference frameworks and thus a path to stochastic geological modeling and inversions. In addition, we provide methods to analyze model topology and to compute gravity fields on the basis of the geological models and assigned density values. In summary, we provide a basis for open scientific research using geological models, with the aim to foster reproducible research in the field of geomodeling.</p>",

		"abstract": "The Tertiary fold-thrust belt in Oscar II Land, central Spitsbergen, consists of three major zones of distinct structural style: (1) a western basement-involved fold-thrust complex, (2) a central zone of thin-skinned fold-thrust units above a decollement in Permian evaporites, and (3) an eastern zone characterized by a frontal duplex system in the fold-thrust belt, bounded eastward by steep, basement-rooted reverse faults (Billefjorden and Lomfjorden fault zones) beneath subhorizontal platform strata. Offshore seismic data from Isfjorden (Statoil) confirm the threefold zonation and document thick-skinned and thin-skinned structural interactions in both the fold-thrust belt and the foreland section. An admissible cross section yields about 45%, or 20 km, of shortening in Oscar II Land. Deeper parts of the seismic profiles show fault-bounded Devonian (central and east) and Carboniferous (west) basins. The structural grain of the Tertiary fold-thrust belt partly coincides with the margin-bounding normal faults of these basins, suggesting that preexisting structures and stratigraphy controlled the Tertiary fold-thrust belt development.A kinematic evolution of the fold-thrust belt is invoked: (1) north-northeast–directed, bedding-parallel shortening, (2) major west-southwest–east-northeast shortening, with in-sequence foreland fold-thrust propagation, (3) basement-involved, west-southwest–east-northeast uplift in the eastern foreland zone, (4) eastward out-of-sequence propagation of thrusts, and (5) west-east extension in the hinterland. Our regional structural compilation map and synthesis of the central Spitsbergen transect advocates structural variation and linked basement-involved thrusting in the hinterland and thin-skinned/thick-skinned reactivation and out-of-sequence thrusting in the east (foreland), and is new compared with previous work of the region. The synthesis also raises several important new structural play concepts for investigating hydrocarbon prospects in Spitsbergen and adjacent regions; for example, inverted Carboniferous basins, and traps produced by Tertiary thin- and thick-skinned contraction and reactivation structures.",

		"abstract": "Summary To verify successful long-term CO2 storage, it is critical to improve our understanding of leakage along natural faults and fractures within the primary caprock. In the proximity of a fault zone, interactions between multiple fracture sets can create complex networks which can play a fundamental role in fluid transport properties within the rock mass. Being able to fully characterise fault and fracture networks, in terms of fracture density, connectivity, aperture size and stress regime, can allow us to more accurately identify, analyse and model the bulk properties (e.g. transport, strength, anisotropy) and, therefore sealing behaviour, of faulted and fractured geological storage sites. Here, we present an integrated workflow which combines laboratory measurements of single fracture permeability with outcrop-scale analysis of fault and fracture networks occurring in reservoir/caprock sections. These data are then used to develop a hydromechanical model to upscale laboratory tests to network-scale and potentially to reservoir-scale, verified against in-situ fault permeability data, where available.",

		"abstract": "The success of geological carbon capture and storage projects depends on the integrity of the top seal, confining injected CO2 in the subsurface for long periods of time. Here, faults and related fracture networks can compromise sealing by providing an interconnected pathway for injected fluids to reach overlying aquifers or even the surface or sea bottom. In this work, we apply an integrated workflow [1] that, combining single fracture stress-permeability laboratory measurements and detailed fault and fracture network outcrop data, builds permeability models of naturally faulted caprock formations for in situ stress conditions.We focus our study on two-dimensional (2D) fault-related fracturing within caprock sequences cut by extensional faults. 2D data of fault and fracture networks were collected from an Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous shale-dominated succession in the Konusdalen area (Nordenskioldland, Svalbard, Norway). The studied rock succession represents the regional caprock and seal for the reservoir of the nearby Longyearbyen CO2 Lab. By digitising all the visible features over the images and then inputting them into the open-source toolbox FracPaQ [2], we obtain information about the fault and fracture networks. In particular, we study the variations in fracture size (i.e., length, height) and density distribution near and away from the fault zone(s), together with the connectivity of fractures within the network. These three parameters are fundamental to establish if the network provides permeable pathways. They also enable us to statistically reproduce and upscale a fracture network in a realistic way.Combining laboratory single fracture stress-permeability measurements with outcrop fracture network data allow us to create an accurate coupled mechanical-hydromechanical model of the natural fracture network and to evaluate the effective permeability of a fault related fracture network. These results are also compared against analytical estimates of effective permeability [3]. With this workflow, we overcome the geometrical simplifications of synthetic fracture models, thus allowing us to establish representative stress-permeability relationships for fractured seals of geological CO2 storage.Reference: [1] March et al., 2020, Preprint; [2] Healy et al., 2017, JSG; [3] Seavik & Nixon, 2017, WRR",

		"abstract": "The patterns of fractures in deformed rocks are rarely uniform or random. Fracture orientations, sizes, and spatial distributions often exhibit some kind of order. In detail, relationships may exist among the different fracture attributes, e.g. small fractures dominated by one orientation, larger fractures by another. These relationships are important because the mechanical (e.g. strength, anisotropy) and transport (e.g. fluids, heat) properties of rock depend on these fracture attributes and patterns. This paper describes FracPaQ, a new open source, cross-platform toolbox to quantify fracture patterns, including distributions in fracture attributes and their spatial variation. Software has been developed to quantify fracture patterns from 2-D digital images, such as thin section micrographs, geological maps, outcrop or aerial photographs or satellite images. The toolbox comprises a suite of MATLAB™ scripts based on previously published quantitative methods for the analysis of fracture attributes: orientations, lengths, intensity, density and connectivity. An estimate of permeability in 2-D is made using a parallel plate model. The software provides an objective and consistent methodology for quantifying fracture patterns and their variations in 2-D across a wide range of length scales, rock types and tectonic settings. The implemented methods presented are inherently scale independent, and a key task where applicable is analysing and integrating quantitative fracture pattern data from micro-to macro-scales. The toolbox was developed in MATLAB™ and the source code is publicly available on GitHub™ and the Mathworks™ FileExchange. The code runs on any computer with MATLAB installed, including PCs with Microsoft Windows, Apple Macs with Mac OS X, and machines running different flavours of Linux. The application, source code and sample input files are available in open repositories in the hope that other developers and researchers will optimise and extend the functionality for the benefit of the wider community.",

		"abstract": "Large amounts of methane are trapped as natural gas hydrate (NGH) in the sediments of the Arctic. Unlike NGH provinces offshore west of Svalbard (Vestnesa Ridge), NGH potential in Svalbard’s fjords and near-shore environment is poorly constrained. In this study we modelled the NGH stability zone (GHSZ) to determine the NGH formation potential within the fjords of Svalbard. We applied a nearest neighbour interpolation method to dynamically derive statistical bottom-water temperature (BWT) trends from available CTD data. The BWT trends along with available geothermal gradient data constrained Svalbard-wide sub-bottom thermobaric models suitable for GHSZ modelling in the near subsurface. Analyses of source rock and fluid seepage data in Isfjorden, including 15 newly identified acoustic gas flares, indicate an active petroleum system with fluid migration reaching the seafloor with significant contributions of higher-order hydrocarbons to the gas feed. A GHSZ is predicted for most fjords at mean BWT conditions and 95:5 methane:ethane gas compositions. Suitable conditions for pure methane NGH formation are only met in the deepest parts of Isfjorden, Hinlopenstretet, Kross- and Kongsfjorden, and Rijpfjorden. Temporal constraints implemented along the well-defined Isfjorden transect indicated a notable negative response to water column warming. The predicted GHSZ across Svalbard’s fjords is likely to disappear over the next few decades.",

		"abstract": "The Tertiary fold-and-thrust belt of Spitsbergen can be divided into a western basement-involved fold-thrust stack and a central-eastern foreland fold-and-thrust belt. In western Nordenskiøld Land the first-order structure is an ENE-verging basement-cored fold and fault complex involving Paleozoic to Tertiary strata. The northern part reveals an upright, monocline geometry of east tilted sedimentary cover units with associated layer parallel to low-angle thrusts and folds. These structures consist of two populations oriented both parallel to (NNW–SSE) and oblique to (WNW–ESE) the general structural trend of the fold complex. In the central and southern parts of west Nordenskiøld Land the fold complex involves tilted basement cut by steep, transverse faults and late normal faults. The east limb of the fold complex displays repeated basement and Paleozoic strata (Orustdalen formation) in its core and Mesozoic (Triassic) strata influenced by map-scale chevron folds and two decollement levels, all located above an eastward rotated, major detachment fault, the Kleivdalen Thrust. Establishing fold-fault relations includes a three-stage structural history in the fold complex as follows: (1) a phase of early NNE–SSW shortening associated with WNW–ESE folds and thrusts and (2) a dominant ENE–WSW, basement-involved shortening leading to the first-order, NNW–SSE-striking fold complex, followed by (3) approximately E–W extension. The resulting structures and structural variability along strike as well as across strike appear to have been controlled by basement and Carboniferous basin structures underlying the Permian-Cretaceous platform strata. Restored stratigraphic sections based on thrust-repetition of basement and cover (e.g., within a type section of the Carboniferous Orustdalen formation) support such an interpretation. A tentative inversion tectonic model reproduces the position(s) of local and major thrust ramps and associated folds, as a result of inheritance from Carboniferous basin structures.",

		"abstract": "Textural and mineralogical properties of the sediment, facies characteristics (both derived from well data), stacking patterns (derived from well and seismic data) and plan-view shapes (derived from seismic data) are all essential components when reconstructing reservoir geometries from subsurface data sets. Without the availability of all these sources of information, reservoir predictions can potentially deviate significantly from the true geometries. In particular, inferences about internal sandbody geometry from plan-view considerations (isopach maps and seismic attribute maps) may lead to erroneous conclusions without knowledge of facies and textural properties of the sediment. Analysis of well-exposed sedimentary systems has the potential to establish links between internal facies characteristics and large-scale geometry and to improve models coupling information at these variable scales. The Palaeogene Battfjellet Formation, Svalbard, has been studied with the aim to unravel internal characteristics and external form by investigating sediment properties, facies and stacking patterns. The formation shows a combination of texturally and mineralogically very immature sediments, a predominance of wave-generated or wave-induced sedimentary structures and a stacking pattern of highly variable numbers of parasequences at localities few kilometres apart that best can be explained in terms of small shifting deltaic lobes that produced a complex pattern of overlapping sandbodies. The strong evidence of wave action in the receiving basin could in itself indicate strike-extensive sandstone bodies; however, the complex sandbody arrangement and the immaturity of the sediments preclude such an interpretation. Traditional facies models coupling plan-view geometries with internal facies characteristics (such as the coupling of strike extensive barrier systems with wave-dominated sedimentary structures or the coupling of elongated fluvial-dominated deltas with offshore-directed current-generated structures) are much too simple and may lead to erroneous interpretations if the complexity revealed by all sources of data is not appreciated.",

		"abstract": "The Lower Cretaceous succession in the Barents Sea is listed as a potential play model by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. Reservoirs may occur in deep to shallow marine clastic wedges located in proximity to palaeo-highs and along basin margins. In addition, shelf-prism-scale clinoforms with high amplitude anomalies in their top- and bottomsets have been reported from reflection seismic but they have never been drilled. In Svalbard, the exposed northwestern corner of the Barents Shelf, Lower Cretaceous strata of shelfal to paralic origin occur, and includes the Rurikfjellet (Valanginian–Hauterivian/lowermost Barremian), Helvetiafjellet (lower Barremian–lower Aptian) and Carolinefjellet formations (lower Aptian–middle Albian). By combining sedimentological outcrop studies and dinocyst analyses with offshore seismic and well ties, this study investigate the link between the onshore strata and the offshore clinoforms. Age-vise, only three (S1–S3) of the seismic sequences defined in the offshore areas correlate to the onshore strata; S1 correspond to the Rurikfjellet Formation, S2 to the Helvetiafjellet Formation and the lower Carolinefjellet Formation, and S3 to the upper Carolinefjellet Formation. Offshore, all three sequences contain generally southward prograding shelf-prism-scale clinoforms. A lower Barremian subaerial unconformity defines the base of the Helvetiafjellet Formation, and its extent indicates that most of the Svalbard platform was exposed and acted as a bypass zone in the early Barremian. Onshore palaeo-current directions is generally towards the SE, roughly consistent with the clinoform accretion-direction towards the S. The local occurrence of a 150 m thick succession of gravity flow deposits transitionally overlain by prodelta slope to delta front deposits in the Rurikfjellet Formation, may indicate that shelf-edges also developed in Svalbard. The late Hauterivian age of theses deposits potentially highlights the inferred offlapping nature of the Lower Cretaceous strata as they predate the lower Barremian unconformity, and thus record a hitherto unknown regression in Svalbard. The presence of the lower Barremian subaerial unconformity in Svalbard, the general southeastward palaeo-current directions, and the age-equivalent clinoform-packages south of Svalbard, suggests that the onshore and offshore strata is genetically linked and was part of the same palaeo-drainage system.",

		"abstract": "The use of three-dimensional (3-D), photo-textured representations of topography from laser scanning and photogrammetry is becoming increasingly common across the geosciences. This rapid adoption is driven by recent innovations in acquisition hardware, software automation, and sensor platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles. In addition, fusion of surface geometry with imaging sensors, such as multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and ground-based radar, and geophysical methods creates complex and visual data sets that provide a fundamental spatial framework to address open geoscience research questions.Despite the current ease of acquiring and processing 3-D photo-textured models, the accessibility of tools for analyzing and presenting data remains problematic, characterized by steep learning curves and custom solutions for individual geoscience applications. Interpretation and measurement is essential for quantitative analysis of 3-D data sets, and qualitative methods are valuable for presentation purposes, for planning, and in education. This contribution presents LIME, a lightweight and high-performance 3-D software for interpreting and co-visualizing 3-D models and related image data. The software allows measurement and interpretation via digitizing in the 3-D scene. In addition, it features novel data integration and visualization of 3-D topography with image sources such as logs and interpretation panels, supplementary wavelength imagery, geophysical data sets, and georeferenced maps and images. High-quality visual output can be generated for dissemination to aid researchers with communication of their results. The motivation and an overview of the software are described, illustrated by example usage scenarios from outcrop geology, multi-sensor data fusion, and geophysical-geospatial data integration.",

		"abstract": "The high Arctic is a remote place, where geoscientific research and teaching require expensive and logistically demanding expeditions to make use of the short field seasons. The absence of vegetation facilitates the use of modern photogrammetric techniques for the cost-effective generation of high-resolution digital outcrop models (DOMs). These georeferenced models can be used in pre-fieldwork activities to help prepare for traditional geological fieldwork, during fieldwork to record observations, and post-fieldwork to conduct quantitative geological analyses. Analyses of DOMs range in scale from mm-cm (e.g., size and spacing of dinosaur footprints), to hundreds of meters (e.g., seismic modeling of outcrops and outcrop-well-seismic correlations) and can advance research objectives. This integration is strengthened if key geoscientific data, like geological and topographical maps, subsurface profiles, borehole data, remote sensing data, geophysical data and DOMs can be integrated through a common database, such as the Svalbox database that we present in this commentary. Svalbox geographically targets the Svalbard archipelago, where fieldwork is challenging due to the harsh polar environment, risk of polar bear encounters and demanding transport to the field area. The University Centre in Svalbard nonetheless relies on utilizing the natural Svalbard environment for its field-based education, and now makes use of Svalbox to make geological fieldwork more efficient and post-fieldwork analyses more quantitative. Experience and usage of such tools in geoscientific education, particularly in the polar regions, is not well documented. Therefore, we share experiences on both developing and optimizing Svalbox, and on student and lecturer usage. Svalbox includes a web-based interface through which DOMs are shared and displayed together with relevant public-domain geoscientific data sets. Svalbox also serves as a platform to share student and teacher experiences on the entire DOM workflow, from acquisition to data distribution. For the Svalbox users questioned by the project group, DOMs were found to provide many benefits, including quantitative analyses, extended field season, appreciation of scale and data sharing that significantly outweigh present-day challenges, such as the need for expensive hardware and lack of easily accessible interpretation software, the latter being surmountable within the near-term.",

		"abstract": "Carbonates represent major hydrocarbon reservoirs, but often exhibit highly heterogeneous reservoir properties. Outcrop analogues provide important insights into how parameters such as porosity, permeability and natural fractures vary. As such, outcrops can bridge the scale gap between spatially extensive but poor-resolution seismic data and 1D high-resolution well data. However, traditional geological fieldwork typically gathers insufficient data to construct robust geological models. In this study, we have specifically set out to gather key data sets that enable the construction of a geology-driven model. We illustrate this workflow using the exceptionally well-exposed carbonate-dominated outcrops of the Kapp Starostin Formation in central Spitsbergen, Arctic Norway. We fully utilize emerging technologies, notably geo-referenced digital outcrop models (DOMs), to be able to gather quantitative sedimentological-structural data from otherwise inaccessible cliffs. DOMs generated from digital photos are used directly for automatic and manual mapping of fractures. The digital data are complemented with traditional fieldwork (sedimentological logging, scanlines, structural characterization) in order to strengthen the dataset. The geo-modelling involves traditional facies and petrophysical modelling of the 12 identified facies, along with outcrop-based discrete fracture modelling. Finally, the static geo-model is upscaled, and its applications are discussed. The presented workflow uses carbonate outcrops of the Kapp Starostin Formation as input but is highly applicable for other studies where outcrops can be utilized as direct input to constrain a geological model.",

		"abstract": "Abstract The renowned Festningen section in the outer part of Isfjorden, western Spitsbergen, offers a c. 7 km-long nearly continuous stratigraphic section of Lower Carboniferous to Cenozoic strata, spanning nearly 300 million years of geological history. Tectonic deformation associated with the Paleogene West-Spitsbergen-Fold-and-Thrust belt tilted the strata to near-vertical, allowing easy access to the section along the shoreline. The Festningen section is a regionally important stratigraphic reference profile, and thus a key locality for any geologist visiting Svalbard. The lithology variations, dinosaur footprints, and the many fossil groups, record more than 300 million years of continental drift, climate change, and sea level variations. In addition, the Festningen section is the only natural geoscientific monument protected by law (i.e. geotope) in Svalbard. In this contribution, we present a digital outcrop model (DOM) of the Festningen section processed from 3762 drone photographs. The resulting high-resolution model offers detail down to 7.01 mm, covers an area of 0.8 km2 and can be freely accessed via the Svalbox database. Through Svalbox, we also put the Festningen model in a regional geological context by comparing it to nearby offshore seismic, exploration boreholes penetrating the same stratigraphy and publications on the deep-time paleoclimate trends recorded at Festningen.",

This article is part of a series from the editors of V3Geo, which is an online forum for sharing high quality virtual 3D geoscience models. Virtual outcrops submitted to V3Geo are subject to a technical quality control to ensure that data can be reliably utilized by the wider professional and scientific community. This document provides guidelines for the robust acquisition of data which are required to build high quality models suitable for sharing in V3Geo. The document focuses on outcrop selection, mission planning, RPV setup, data acquisition and management. Related documents in this series cover data processing and model building.",

		"abstract": "The study of outcrop analogues of petroleum reservoirs is well established in the petroleum industry through the use of digital outcrop models (DOMs). These models, which are also known as virtual outcrop models (VOMs) or 3D outcrops, are of great importance for understanding the behavior of actual reservoirs. This topic has been reviewed by many authors, and the studies vary in detail according to the technologies involved. The present study applies systematic review methodology traversing a number of articles to find the trends in studies utilizing DOMs. The articles included in this review indicate that the technologies used to generate DOMs are still predominantly classified as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and digital photogrammetry, with the first being present in most of the works, and the latter attracting attention owing to the popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These studies have attracted a significant amount of attention to outcrop analysis, and the information acquired can be used to better fit reservoir simulations. Furthermore, a trend is identified with a focus on outcrop geometry and structural data. This work also discusses some of the available opportunities related to the generation of DOMs as well as emerging technologies that can improve the quality of the outcrop models in order to provide better reservoir simulations. Finally, this work discusses the findings and highlights of the articles answering the initially raised research questions.",

Der det ikke ennå er konstruert fra flybilder, er modellene generert fra høydekurver, vann og kystkontur. De heldekkende modellene oppdateres flere ganger årlig. Heldekkende modell er av 20 og 50 meters oppløsning, mens delmodellene har oppløsning på 5 meter (2 meter for Bjørnøya). Heldekkende terrengmodell, 20 meters oppløsning: Standardavvik for områder med data generert fra stereomodeller er ca 2-5 meter, unntatt i isbreområder, hvor det kan være noe høyere. Standardavvik for områder med data generert fra eldre høydekurver, vann og kystlinje er ca. 25 meter. Heldekkende terrengmodell, 50 meters oppløsning: Modellen er en generalisert utgave av 20 meters-modellen (bilinært resamplet). Ettersom 20 meters-modellen er satt sammen av ulike delmodeller med ulik kvalitet og dato, vil en kunne se hakk eller brå overganger lokalt mellom delene i modellen. ----- Terrain models for the whole and parts of Svalbard, at different resolutions. The models are mainly generated from stereo models where constructed on newer aerial photos. Where such construction is not yet done, the models are generated from elevation contours, lakes and coastlines. The all-covering models are updated several times yearly. The all-covering models are at resolution 20 and 50 metres, while the regional models are at resolution 5 metres (2 metres for Bjørnøya). All-covering terrain model, 20 meter resolution: The standard deviation for areas with data generated from stereo models is approx. 2-5 metres, except in glaciated areas, where it can be somewhat higher. The standard deviation for areas with data generated from older elevation contours, lakes and coastlines, is approx. 25 metres. All-covering terrain model, 50 meter resolution: The model is generalized from the 20 meter model (bilinear resampled). As the 20 metre model is a mosaic of different subset models with different quality and date, sudden drops and lines in the terrain might be visible locally between subsets in the model.",

Information on active layer dynamics, permafrost and ground ice characteristics and selected periglacial features is summarized from the recent literature and from unpublished data by the authors. Permafrost thickness ranges from less than 100 m near the coasts to more than 500 m in the highlands. Ground ice is present as rock glaciers, as ice-cored moraines, buried glacial ice, and in pingos and ice wedges in major valleys. Engineering problems of thaw-settlement and frost-heave are described, and the implications for road design and construction in Svalbard permafrost areas are discussed.",

		"abstract": "A key role in the successful implementation of any learning approach is played by teachers, so how well blended learning works will depend largely on how well teachers make the transition from their traditional face-to-face classroom roles to the wider more complex role that blended learning requires. The additional skills and the forging of a new professional identity might not come easily to all practitioners.This paper evaluates the impact that the introduction of blended learning in a distance language learning course has had on teachers. It presents and discusses findings from a small-scale evaluation study which compared quantitative and qualitative data gathered through a survey and a small number of interviews with participant observations from the researcher and the institutional end-of-course debriefing report.The paper argues that whilst technological challenges and the sheer amount of change that teachers were faced with were largely responsible for some of the negative attitudes reflected in teachers’ opinions about the course, a less obvious, broader explanation for the difficulties that teachers encountered might be found in the way that learning, teaching and training are conceptualised by both teachers and the institution.It is proposed that a transmission of knowledge approach to training fails to acknowledge and properly support the transformation of teachers’ identity that results from moving from traditional classroom-based teaching to online teaching. The shift goes beyond the acquisition of ICT skills and requires a pedagogical understanding of the affordances of the new medium and an acceptance by the teacher of his or her new role and identity.",

The design of the Jupyter notebook is in many ways well suited for teaching subjects in information technology and computer science, but it is a tool that departs significantly from a standard text editor or integrated development environment, and thus carries with it several unique advantages as well as several surprising potential pitfalls. As use of Jupyter notebooks has grown, so has criticism of the notebook, for varied reasons: notebooks can behave in unexpected ways, they can be difficult to reproduce, they open up potential security issues, and they may encourage poor coding practices. A set of best practices to guide instructors and help addressing these concerns when using Jupyter notebooks in the classroom is currently lacking. This paper addresses the strengths and weaknesses of the Jupyter notebook for education, drawing on existing literature as well as the author's experience teaching a range of courses with Jupyter notebooks for over five years, and recommends a set of best practices for teaching with the Jupyter notebook.",

Despite their ease of use, the amount of data obtained in this way is normally smaller than would be considered as representative of the area available for sampling. LiDAR-based remote sensors are capable of sampling large areas and providing huge sets of digitized spatial points. However, the visual identification of planes in sets of points on geological outcrops is a difficult and time-consuming task. An automatic method for detecting and estimating the orientation of planar structures has been developed to reduce analysis and processing times, and to fit the best plane for each surface represented by a set of points and thus to increase the sampled area. The algorithm detects clusters of points that are part of the same plane based on the principal component analysis (PCA) technique. When applied to real cases, it has shown high precision in both the detection and orientation of fractures planes.",

Here we present the result of automated fracture extraction of high-resolution photogrammetric images (0.9 cm/pixel) of the full outcrop, obtained using an unmanned aerial vehicle, to obtain a spatially extensive, full-resolution map of the complete fracture network with nearly 350,000 ground-truthed fractures. We developed graph-based functions to resolve some common issues that arise in automatic fracture tracing such as incomplete traces, incorrect topology, artificial fragmentation, and linking of fracture segments to generate geologically significant trace interpretations. The fracture networks corresponding to different regions within the outcrop are compared using several network metrics and the results indicate both inter- and intra-network (layer to layer) structural variabilities. The dataset is a valuable benchmark in the study of large-scale natural fracture networks and its extension to stochastic network generation in geomodelling. The dataset also highlights the intrinsic spatial variation in natural fracture networks that can occur even in weakly-deformed rocks over relatively short length scales of tens of metres.",

		"abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> The Covid-19 pandemic occurred at a time of major revolution in the geosciences – the era of digital geology. Digital outcrop models (DOMs) acquired from consumer drones, processed using user-friendly photogrammetric software and shared with the wider audience through online platforms are a cornerstone of this digital geological revolution. Integration of DOMs with other geoscientific data, such as geological maps, satellite imagery, terrain models, geophysical data and field observations, strengthens their application in both research and education. Teaching geology with digital tools advances students' learning experience by providing access to high-quality outcrops, enhancing visualization of 3D geological structures and improving data integration. Similarly, active use of DOMs to integrate new field observations will facilitate more effective fieldwork and quantitative research. From a student's perspective, georeferenced and scaled DOMs allow for an improved appreciation of scale and of 3D architecture, which is a major threshold concept in geoscientific education.</p> <p>DOMs allow us to bring geoscientists to the outcrops digitally, which is particularly important in view of the Covid-19 pandemic that restricts travel and thus direct access to outcrops. At the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS), located at 78<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>∘</sup></span> N in Longyearbyen in Arctic Norway, DOMs are actively used even in non-pandemic years, as the summer field season is short and not overlapping with the Bachelor “Arctic Geology” course package held from January to June each year. In 2017, we at UNIS developed a new course (AG222 “Integrated Geological Methods: From Outcrop To Geomodel”) to encourage the use of emerging techniques like DOMs and data integration to solve authentic geoscientific challenges. In parallel, we have established the open-access Svalbox geoscientific portal, which forms the backbone of the AG222 course activities and provides easy access to a growing number of DOMs, 360<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>∘</sup></span> imagery, subsurface data and published geoscientific data from Svalbard. Considering the rapid onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Svalbox portal and the pre-Covid work on digital techniques in AG222 allowed us to rapidly adapt and fulfil at least some of the students' learning objectives during the pandemic. In this contribution, we provide an overview of the course development and share experiences from running the AG222 course and the Svalbox platform, both before and during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>",

A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.",

		"abstract": "Igneous intrusions act as both carriers and barriers to subsurface fluid flow and are therefore expected to significantly influence the distribution and migration of groundwater and hydrocarbons in volcanic basins. Given the low matrix permeability of igneous rocks, the effective permeability in- and around intrusions is intimately linked to the characteristics of their associated fracture networks. Natural fracturing is caused by numerous processes including magma cooling, thermal contraction, magma emplacement and mechanical disturbance of the host rock. Fracturing may be locally enhanced along intrusion–host rock interfaces, at dyke–sill junctions, or at the base of curving sills, thereby potentially enhancing permeability associated with these features. In order to improve our understanding of fractures associated with intrusive bodies emplaced in sedimentary host rocks, we have investigated a series of outcrops from the Karoo Basin of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, where the siliciclastic Burgersdorp Formation has been intruded by various intrusions (thin dykes, mid-sized sheet intrusions and thick sills) belonging to the Karoo dolerite. We present a quantified analysis of fracturing in- and around these igneous intrusions based on five outcrops at three individual study sites, utilizing a combination of field data, high-resolution lidar virtual outcrop models and image processing. Our results show a significant difference between the three sites in terms of fracture orientation. The observed differences can be attributed to contrasting intrusion geometries, outcrop geometry (for lidar data) and tectonic setting. Two main fracture sets were identified in the dolerite at two of the sites, oriented parallel and perpendicular to the contact respectively. Fracture spacing was consistent between the three sites, and exhibits a higher degree of variation in the dolerites compared to the host rock. At one of the study sites, fracture frequency in the surrounding host rock increases slightly toward the intrusion at approximately 3m from the contact. We conclude by presenting a conceptual fluid flow model, showing permeability enhancement and a high potential for fluid flow-channeling along the intrusion–host rock interfaces.",

Previous studies of the Agardhfjellet Formation do not accurately reflect the distribution of invertebrates throughout the unit as they were limited to sampling discontinuous intervals at outcrop. The rock core material shows the benthic bivalve fauna to reflect dysoxic, but not anoxic environments for the Oxfordian – lower Kimmeridgian interval with sporadic monospecific assemblages of epifaunal bivalves, and more favourable conditions in the Volgian, with major increases in abundance and diversity of Hartwellia sp. assemblages. Overall, the new information from cores show that abundance, diversity and stratigraphic continuity of the fossil record in the Upper Jurassic of Spitsbergen are considerably higher than indicated in outcrop studies. The inferred life positions and feeding habits of the benthic fauna refine the understanding of the depositional environments of the Agardhfjellet Formation. The occurrence pattern of the bivalve genera is correlated with published studies of Arctic localities in East Greenland and Northern Siberia and shows similarities in palaeoecology with the former but not the latter. Ammonite biostratigraphy is used as a tool to date bivalve assemblage overturning events to help identify similar changes in other sections.",

		"abstract": "The Longyearbyen CO2 Lab aims to capture carbon dioxide emitted by the local coal-fuelled power plant and store it in an unconventional, siliciclastic, Late Triassic - Middle Jurassic reservoir located at ca. 700 to 1000 m depth. The caprock consists of Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous shales of the Agardhfjellet Formation, characterized by organic rich, highly fissile mudstones with silty intervals, reflecting offshore anoxic conditions. Pressure data observations, including severe underpressure in the reservoir and an overpressured aquifer above the top seal, suggest efficient sealing properties of the caprock, confirmed by numerous leak-off tests. In addition, a natural gas accumulation is envisaged to be capped by internal horizontal barriers in the cap rock. Despite the proven sealing capacity of the Agardhfjellet Formation its lower section is intensely fractured, as demonstrated by observations in outcrops and drill cores. These fractures could be reactivated and exploited as preferential fluid flow pathways during and after CO2 injection. In this study we characterize the natural fracture network in the two lowermost members (i.e. Oppdalen and Lardyfjellet Mbs.) of the Agardhfjellet Formation in order to quantify its architecture and predict the fluid flow pathways. We conducted manual fracture mapping on 90 m of continuous drill core to quantify the vertical distribution of predominantly sub-horizontal and low angle fractures. Field data (i.e. scanlines) were used to quantify horizontal distribu-tion and orientation of the sub-vertical fractures and determine if they are genetically linked to sub-seismic faults present in the section. Wireline logs including an acoustic televiewer and caliper meas-urements supplemented those data. In addition, ground and drone-based photogrammetry was applied to generate 3D models of laterally and vertically extensive outcrops for both stratigraphic and structural correlations. About 1500 fractures from cores and 1000 fractures from the field were obtained and pro-cessed. Our results indicate a predominance of low angle fracturing, sometimes with striations, throughout the majority of the analyzed core interval. In addition, outcrop data mainly consist of high angle joints. The fracture trends observed in the field exhibit dominant E-W and N-S directions. The estimated vertical fracture frequency is up to 20 fractures per meter, with a horizontal fracture spacing between 2.5 and 40 cm, possibly providing a pervasive network of fluid migration pathways. From a structural complexity viewpoint, it therefore appears uncertain whether the investigated lower section of the Agardhfjellet Formation represents the inferred horizontal pressure barrier.",

		"abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> V3Geo is a cloud-based repository for publishing virtual 3D models in geoscience. The system allows storage, search and visualisation of mesh models typically acquired using techniques such as photogrammetry and laser scanning. The platform has been developed to handle models at the range of scales typically used by geoscientists from microscopic, hand samples and fossils through to outcrop sections or terrain covering metres to tens of kilometres. The cloud storage system serves the models to a purpose-built 3D web viewer. Models are tiled to ensure efficient streaming over the Internet. The web viewer allows 3D models to be interactively explored without the need for specialist software to be installed. A measurement tool enables users to gauge simple dimensions, such as widths, thicknesses, and fault throws. V3Geo allows very large models comprising multiple sections and is designed to include additional interpretation layers. The specific focus on geoscience data is supported by defined metadata and a classification schema. Public and private storage is available, and public models are assigned Creative Commons licenses to govern content usage. This paper presents V3Geo as a sustainable resource for the geoscience community, including the motivation and main characteristics and features. Example usage scenarios are highlighted: from undergraduate geology teaching, supporting virtual geoscience education and preparing virtual field trips based on V3Geo models. Finally, best practice guidelines for preparing 3D model contributions for publication on V3Geo are included as the Appendix.</p>",

		"abstract": "Offshore drilling in basins with a significant basaltic component poses a number of complications to drilling operations. These include slow and variable rates of penetration (ROP), drilling fluid losses, drill bit or string sticking, overpressured formations, wellbore spalling and collapse. In this contribution we investigate features of large igneous province (LIP) volcanic facies that may directly contribute to drilling complications. Combining borehole and field based examples we identify highly vesicular brecciated lava flow tops and hydro-volcanic facies as a major potential cause of catastrophic drilling fluid losses. The risk for drilling losses is generally higher in the upper parts of thick volcanic successions where hydrothermal secondary mineralization and alteration may be less pervasive. We demonstrate how these facies may be identified early by integrating real time mud logging data with characteristic drill cuttings and LWD (logging while drilling) wireline data as it becomes available. We highlight the potential of basaltic formations to maintain porosity and permeability to greater depths than is typical for sediments due to the high compressive strength of crystalline basalt frameworks. The heterogeneous sub surface distribution of key volcanic facies commonly includes intimate mixing and layering of hard and dense with soft and weak volcanic rock which may promote complex in-situ stresses to develop during burial compaction. Where this occurs, wellbore stability predictions such as the fracture and wellbore collapse gradients for volcanic sequences may deviate from those expected in basin equivalent sedimentary sequences. Examples of swelling volcanic clay horizons, unstable volcaniclastic sequences, and intrusion related ledge effects are used to characterize the main causes of drill bit and string sticking. A greater understanding of drilling complications encountered within prospective areas containing volcanic sequences is needed if better pre-drilling risk assessment, cost prediction, real-time identification and mitigation is to be achieved.",

		"abstract": "Data acquired from petroleum exploration well 164/7-1 drilled in the UK sector of the Rockall Trough have yielded fresh insights into the igneous and thermal history of this frontier region. The well targeted a large four-way dip closed structure of presumed Mesozoic age named ‘The Dome Prospect’. The structure is now known to have a magmatic, rather than a purely structural origin, which was the preferred pre-well interpretation. The well encountered 1.2 km of Palaeocene age basaltic lavas, overlying Late Cretaceous mudstones which were intruded by over 70 dolerite sills ranging from <1.5- to 152-m thick. 40Ar/39Ar dating of the dolerite intrusions indicates an Early Palaeocene age (63–64±0.5 Ma), which are among the oldest 40Ar/39Ar dates recognised in the North Atlantic Igneous Province. Radiometric dating of the overlying basaltic lavas proved unsuccessful, because of excessive alteration. Biostratigraphic dating of underlying and overlying sedimentary strata was utilised to constrain the age of the lavas to Late Paleocene to Early Eocene age (∼55 Ma). Despite being related to two distinct events separated by ∼8 Ma, the intrusives and extrusives are compositionally similar. The basaltic rocks from well 164/7-1 possess Sr–Nd isotopic, major and trace-element geochemical compositions similar to other volcanic and intrusive rocks of the British Tertiary Igneous Province and represent partial melts of both lithospheric and asthenospheric mantle associated with the proto-Icelandic mantle plume head. Joint consideration of thermal maturity, potential fields and 3D seismic data indicate a deeper igneous body in addition to the sills encountered in well 164/7-1. Jack-up and arching mechanisms associated with both scales of intrusive body are believed to have developed the dome structure. The preferred interpretation is of a mafic laccolith, 17 km in diameter, ∼7 km thick, intruded at 64.5 Ma, situated ∼2.5 km below the bottom of the well. 3D thermal modelling suggests that all of Tranche 52 was thermally affected by the intrusion of the magmatic body. The thermal aureole, between 27 and 51 km in diameter, is not thought to play an important role in the hydrocarbon prospectivity of the surrounding Tranches in the NE Rockall Basin. Results show that hydrocarbon exploration prospects that are circular in map view should be interpreted with caution on volcanic continental margins. In sedimentary basins, where salt domes and shale diapirs are absent and igneous rocks prevalent, periclinal structures such as ‘The Dome Prospect’ should undergo a thorough multi-disciplinary risk assessment.",

		"abstract": "Uniaxial test (also called unconfined compression test) is one of most important tests used to measure rock strength. It is critical to obtain the rock strength parameters along the wellbore. Awareness of rock strength could better control drilling problems such as pipe sticking, tight hole, collapse, pack off and sand production. Rock strength also controls the drilling rate of penetration (ROP). The calculations of uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) are based on a simplified version of the ROP model proposed for tricone bits. The purpose of this research was to predict the uniaxial compressive strength based on sonic logs as a function of sonic travel and formation porosity. For obtaining continuous log strength along the wellbore in Ahwaz oilfield, quantitative relationships were developed between UCS and sonic travel time as well as UCS and both of sonic travel time and formation porosity. They actually are the outcome of regression analysis that resulting relationships are very practical and most often are specified by the researcher to the region of study. In this work, a larger well segment has been analyzed which there is no information break throughout the segment and it is investigated continuously. Using this approach, 3D model was a better predictor of uniaxial compressive strength than obtained equations related to transient time and results have also confirmed that the use of an recommended equations in this study can reduce drilling costs significantly.",

		"abstract": "Fluvial deposits are highly heterogeneous and inherently challenging to map in outcrop due to a combination of lateral and vertical variability along with a lack of continuous exposure. Heavily incised landscapes, such as badlands, reveal continuous three-dimensional (3-D) outcrops that are ideal for constraining the geometry of fluvial deposits and enabling reconstruction of channel morphology through time and space. However, these complex 3-D landscapes also create challenges for conventional field mapping techniques, which offer limited spatial resolution, coverage, and/or lateral contiguity of measurements. To address these limitations, we examined an emerging technique using images acquired from a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetric processing to generate a 3-D digital outcrop model (DOM). We applied the UAV-SfM technique to develop a DOM of an Upper Cretaceous channel-belt sequence exposed within a 0.52 km2 area of Dinosaur Provincial Park (southeastern Alberta, Canada). Using the 3-D DOM, we delineated the lower contact of the channel-belt sequence, created digital sedimentary logs, and estimated facies with similar conviction to field-based estimations (±4.9%). Lateral accretion surfaces were also recognized and digitally traced within the DOM, enabling measurements of accretion direction (dip azimuth), which are nearly impossible to obtain accurately in the field. Overall, we found that measurements and observations derived from the UAV-SfM DOM were commensurate with conventional ground-based mapping techniques, but they had the added advantage of lateral continuity, which aided interpretation of stratigraphic surfaces and facies. This study suggests that UAV-SfM DOMs can complement traditional field-based methods by providing detailed 3-D views of topographically complex outcrop exposures spanning intermediate to large spatial extents.",

		"abstract": "Geological models from outcrop analogues are often utilized as a guide, or soft constraint, for distributing reservoir properties in subsurface models. In carbonate outcrops, combined sequence stratigraphic, sedimentological, and petrographic studies constrain the heterogeneity of geobodies and diagenetic processes, including dolomitization, at multiple scales. High-resolution digital outcrop modeling further aids geometric mapping, geobody definition, and statistical analysis, though its usefulness for detailed mineralogical and lithological mapping is limited. Hyperspectral imaging offers enhanced spectral resolution for mapping subtle mineralogical differences. In both outcrops and subsurface, differences in carbonate composition can provide key information for distributing porosity and permeability, yet this mapping is highly challenging in field studies due to access difficulties, visible material differences, and sampling resolution. Spectral analysis of limestone–dolomite ratios conducted in laboratory studies indicates theoretical measures for quantitative identification and mapping of dolomite degrees within carbonate rocks. In this study, close-range hyperspectral imaging is applied to outcrops of the Alacón Member, Barranco del Mortero, northeastern Spain, to identify exposed limestone–dolomite geobodies and to quantify the degree of dolomitization across outcrop faces. Hyperspectral imaging is supplemented with photogrammetric outcrop modeling, field spectroscopy, and laboratory sample analysis for empirical validation and uncertainty analysis. Hyperspectral mapping shows that earlier fieldwork utilizing visual inspection of difficult to access outcrop surfaces had overestimated the amount of dolomite in the outcrop. Results indicate that hyperspectral imaging identified dolomite bodies more accurately and reliably than conventional field methods and facilitates the mapping of dolomite contribution in areas modified by dedolomitization, where dolomite content changes by more than ~20%.",

		"abstract": "A new map of the extent of continental crust shows that the continents are more extensive and less dispersed than they are conventionally thought to be. Their total area is 210.4 × 106 km², or 41% of the earth's surface, and there are 14 of them. Continent-ocean contacts are mapped on the basis of a literature survey, and continent-continent contacts are drawn along plate boundaries; thus although Eurasia is still the largest continent, it does not include the separate continents India and Arabia and surrenders northeastern Siberia to North America. Much of the Arctic Ocean is underlain by North American continental crust, and North America is the second-largest continent. Central America and New Zealand are recognized as continents, the latter being nine-tenths submerged, and there are four microcontinents: Rockall, Seychelles, Agulhas, and Jan Mayen. Several oceanic windows, enclaves within the continents, must be recognized if the extent of the continents is to be accurately delineated. The average thickness of continental crust is 36 km; small continents seem to be thinner than large ones, and height and thickness are strongly interdependent. The total volume of continental crust is 7.2 × 109 km³, somewhat less than the 8.0 × 109 km³ estimate of Ronov and Yaroshevskiy (1977). Mean heights are significantly lower than the 875 m commonly quoted from Kossinna (1933), because submerged parts of the continents (30.6% of their total area) are correctly accounted for; the new estimate of mean height is ∼120 m. The relationship between mean height and area for individual continents, however, is still observed. Modal heights are not correlated with area and are ∼ 250 m for most of the large continents. Certain continents have anomalous mean or modal heights, suggesting that the mean height-area relationship arises from greater relative lengths of orogenic belts around and internal tectonism within larger continents; anomalous modal heights suggest anomalous epeirogenic activity. These results may have implications for the hypsometry of ancient continents: in particular, Pangea need not have had a modal height much different from that observed today.",

Considering data on both sources and sinks for atmospheric carbon and various conceptual schemes of the global carbon dioxide cycle, they suggest a new approach to studies of the problem of the greenhouse effect. They assess the role of different types of soil and vegetation in the assimilation of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and discuss models of the atmosphere ocean gas exchange and its role in the carbon dioxide cycle, paying special attention to the role of the Arctic Basin. The authors also consider models of other global atmospheric cycles for a range of atmospheric constituents, and conclude by drawing together a range of scenarios on modelling the global carbon cycle.",

		"abstract": "Continental rifting is often associated with voluminous magmatism and perturbations in the Earth's climate. In this study, we use 2D seismic data from the northeast Greenland margin to document two Paleogene-aged sill complexes ≥18000 and ≥10000 km2 in size. Intrusion of the sills resulted in the contact metamorphism of carbon-rich shales, producing thermogenic methane which was released via 52 newly discovered hydrothermal vent complexes, some of which reach up to 11 km in diameter. Mass balance calculations indicate that the volume of methane produced by these intrusive complexes is comparable to that required to have caused the negative δ13C isotope excursion associated with the PETM. Combined with data from the conjugate Norwegian margin, our study provides evidence for margin-scale, volcanically-induced greenhouse gas release during the late Paleocene/early Eocene. Given the abundance of similar-aged sill complexes in Upper Paleozoic–Mesozoic and Cretaceous–Tertiary basins elsewhere along the northeast Atlantic continental margin, our findings support a major role for volcanism in driving global climate change.",

		"abstract": "Ancient hydrothermal vent complexes have released large volumes of greenhouse gases in the past causing global warming, and similar modern vent structures are potential geohazards. In the NE Atlantic, thousands of hydrothermal vent complexes were formed during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. In Java, Indonesia, the erupting Lusi sediment-hosted geothermal system caused the displacement of 40,000 people. In order to determine how ancient and modern hydrothermal venting systems are related, we map a well-defined buried hydrothermal vent complex offshore mid-Norway using 3D seismic reflection data and then compare it to the active Lusi eruption (since 2006) and the neighboring inactive Porong Structure. These are characterized using 2D seismic reflection data, borehole data and field observations. The venting structures are subcircular in plan-view and a few kilometers in diameter. They are funnel-shaped in profiles, with inward-dipping beds surrounding the conduits. The hydrothermal vent complex offshore mid-Norway reveals five seismically-distinct vent fill facies units. Importantly, two of the facies units are separated by an angular unconformity, clearly indicating that the depositional events within the vent fill were distinct. Hydrothermal fluids are interpreted to have led to the fluidization of mud-rich sediments which were erupted and deposited in and around the vent complex. Interpretation of a seismically transparent body along the conduit of the Norwegian venting structure, and the abrupt widening of the conduit at the Porong Structure, are interpreted to be caused by changes in fluid-flow dynamics as the fluids rise and get released from the host-rock. The hydrothermal venting systems in Java and offshore mid-Norway are found to be morphologically similar and are interpreted to form as the result of the transport and eruption of fluidized sediments.",

The mid-Norwegian Margin is a global type example of such volcanic rifted margins and is well suited for scientific drilling with its thin sediment cover and good data coverage. During International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 396, 21 boreholes were drilled at 10 sites in five different geological settings on this volcanic margin. The boreholes sampled a multitude of igneous and sedimentary settings ranging from lava flow fields to hydrothermal vent complexes, along with thick successions of upper Paleocene and lower Eocene strata. A comprehensive suite of wireline logs was collected in eight boreholes. The main goals of the expedition were to provide constraints for geodynamic models to test different hypotheses that can explain the rapid emplacement of large igneous provinces and the hypothesis that the associated Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum was caused by hydrothermal release of carbon in response to magmatic intrusions. Successful drilling, combined with high core recovery of target intervals of all nine primary sites and one additional alternate site, should allow us to achieve these goals during postcruise work.",

But how safe and how efficient is burial? The design and long-term viability of a site depend critically on how and where the CO2 is stored. Natural gas fields can serve as analogues for safe geological storage of anthropogenic CO2 over millennial timescales, and now a study using noble gas and carbon isotope tracers has characterized the processes involved in removal of the CO2 phase in nine natural gas fields from North America, China and Europe. The dominant sink is found to be dissolution in formation water, with fixation in carbonate minerals playing only a minor role. This suggests that models of long-term storage of CO2 waste in similar geological systems need to focus on the potential mobility of CO2 dissolved in water.",

		"abstract": "Flood basalts are receiving increasing attention as possible host formations for geologic sequestration of anthropogenic CO2, with studies underway in the United States, India, Iceland, and Canada. Basalts from the United States, India, and South Africa were reacted with aqueous dissolved CO2 and aqueous dissolved CO2–H2S mixtures under supercritical CO2 (scCO2) conditions to study the geochemical reactions resulting from injection of CO2 in such formations. Despite the basalt samples having similar bulk chemical composition, mineralogy and dissolution kinetics, long-term static experiments show significant differences in rates of mineralization as well as compositions and morphologies of precipitates that form when the basalts are reacted with CO2 and CO2–H2S mixtures in water. For example, basalt from the Newark Basin in the United States was by far the most reactive of any basalt tested to date. Reacted grains from the Newark Basin basalt appeared severely weathered and contained extensive carbonate precipitates with significant Fe content. In comparison, the post-reacted samples associated with the Columbia River basalts from the United States contained calcite grains with classic “dogtooth spar” morphology and trace cation substitution (Mg and Mn). Carbonation of the other basalts produced precipitates with compositions that varied chemically throughout the entire testing period. The Karoo basalt from South Africa appeared the least reactive, with very limited mineralization occurring during the testing with CO2-saturated water. Compositional differences in the precipitates suggest changes in fluid chemistry unique to the dissolution behavior of each basalt sample reacted with CO2-saturated water. No convincing correlations were identified between basalt reactivity and differences in bulk composition, mineralogy, glassy mesostasis quantity or composition. Moreover, the relative reactivity of different basalt samples was unexpectedly different in the experiments conducted with aqueous dissolved CO2–H2S mixtures versus those with CO2 only. For example, the Karoo basalt was highly reactive in the presence of aqueous dissolved CO2–H2S, as evident by nodules of carbonate coating the basalt grains after 181 days of testing. However, the most reactive basalt in CO2–H2O, Newark Basin, formed only iron sulfide coatings in tests with a CO2–H2S mixture, which inhibited carbonate mineralization.",

		"abstract": "Spring waters emerging from partly serpentinised ultramafic rocks in the Semail Ophiolite Nappe of Northern Oman are of a calcium hydroxide type. They have pH values of 10 to 12, are unusually saline and possess anomalous stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions. The springs, which occur mainly at the contact between “mantle” and “crustal” rock divisions, have low discharge rates and originate by chemical evolution from the recharge of magnesium bicarbonate surface waters. Rare, and in some cases, previously unidentified features associated with these springs include; deuterium depleted hydrogen and nitrogen gases, suolunite, magnesian huntite, brucite, portlandite and amorphous calcium hydroxide. Spring water compositions, petrographic features, and variations in the chemical compositions of the ultramafic rock secondary assemblage, provide strong evidence for the occurrence of both low and high temperature serpentisation processes. These low temperature reactions take place under relatively arid hydrological conditions where groundwater flow is restricted, atmospheric CO2 and O2 are completely removed from solution and the normal surface weathering processes are thusinhibited. The unusual isotopic composition of the waters is explained in terms of isotopic exchange between surface waters and hydrous minerals in the groundwater environment related to the low water/rock ratio. The high salt concentrations in the spring waters are derived from the leaching of sea salts introduced during the emplacement of the nappe. Whilst the low temperature serpentinisation processes control the chemical characteristics of the spring waters, it is concluded that the earlier pervasive phase of partial serpentinisation occured at higher temperatures (up to 350°C) whe the ophiolite was obducted from an obducted from an oceanic to an epicontinental environment.",

Here we report the discovery of an extensive hydrothermal field at 30° N near the eastern intersection of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Atlantis fracture zone. The vent field—named ‘Lost City’—is distinctly different from all other known sea-floor hydrothermal fields in that it is located on 1.5-Myr-old crust, nearly 15 km from the spreading axis, and may be driven by the heat of exothermic serpentinization reactions between sea water and mantle rocks. It is located on a dome-like massif and is dominated by steep-sided carbonate chimneys, rather than the sulphide structures typical of ‘black smoker’ hydrothermal fields. We found that vent fluids are relatively cool (40–75 °C) and alkaline (pH 9.0–9.8), supporting dense microbial communities that include anaerobic thermophiles. Because the geological characteristics of the Atlantis massif are similar to numerous areas of old crust along the Mid-Atlantic, Indian and Arctic ridges, these results indicate that a much larger portion of the oceanic crust may support hydrothermal activity and microbial life than previously thought.",

Most lava flows have flow tops that are porous and permeable and have enormous capacity for storage of CO2. Interbedded sediment layers and dense low-permeability basalt rock overlying sequential flows may act as effective seals allowing time for mineralization reactions to occur. Laboratory experiments confirm relatively rapid chemical reaction of CO2-saturated pore water with basalts to form stable carbonate minerals. Calculations suggest a sufficiently short time frame for onset of carbonate precipitation after CO2 injection that verification of in situ mineralization rates appears feasible in field pilot studies. If proven viable, major flood basalts in the United States and India would provide significant additional CO2 storage capacity and additional geologic sequestration options in certain regions where more conventional storage options are limited.",

CO2 storage in reactive basalts might be one of these solutions by permanently converting injected gaseous CO2 into solid carbonates. Herein, we report results from a field demonstration in which ∼1000 metric tons of CO2 was injected into a natural basalt formation in eastern Washington state. Following post-injection monitoring for 2 years, cores were obtained from within the injection zone and subjected to detailed physical and chemical analysis. Nodules found in vesicles throughout the cores were identified as the carbonate mineral, ankerite Ca[Fe,Mg,Mn](CO3)2. Carbon isotope analysis showed the nodules are chemically distinct compared with natural carbonates present in the basalt and in clear correlation with the isotopic signature of the injected CO2. These findings provide field validation of rapid mineralization rates observed from years of laboratory testing with basalts.",

		"abstract": "Over millions of years, the interaction of marine basalt with percolating seawater in low-temperature ocean floor hydrothermal systems leads to the formation of calcite and aragonite. The presence of these minerals in marine basalts provides evidence for substantial CO2 fixation in these rocks. Here, we report on laboratory experiments to study this process under enhanced CO2 partial pressures (pCO2) at 130 °C. Mid-ocean-ridge-basalt (MORB) glass was reacted with North Atlantic Seawater charged with CO2 in batch experiments lasting up to 7 months. For experiments initiated with seawater charged with ~2.5 bar pCO2, calcite and aragonite are the first carbonate minerals to form, later followed by only aragonite (±siderite and ankerite). For experiments initiated with seawater charged with ~16 bar pCO2, magnesite was the only carbonate mineral observed to form. In total, approximately 20% of the initial CO2 in the reactors was mineralized within five months. This carbonation rate is similar to corresponding rates observed in freshwater-basalt-CO2 interaction experiments and during field experiments of the carbonation of basalts in response to CO2-charged freshwater injections in SW-Iceland. Our experiments thus suggest that CO2-charged seawater injected into submarine basalts will lead to rapid CO2 mineralization. Notably, at pCO2 of tens of bars, magnesite will form, limiting the formation of Mg-rich clays, which might otherwise compete for the Mg cation and pore-space in the submarine basaltic crust. This suggests that the injection of CO2-charged seawater into subsurface basalts can be an efficient and effective approach to the long-term safe mineral storage of anthropogenic carbon.",

		"abstract": "Since the Industrial Revolution, anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have grown exponentially, accumulating in the atmosphere and leading to global warming. According to the IPCC (IPCC Special Report, 2018), atmospheric warming should be <2°C to avoid the most serious consequences associated with climate change. This goal may be achieved in part by reducing CO2 emissions, together with capturing and sequestering CO2 from point sources. The most mature storage technique is sequestration in deep saline aquifers. In addition, CO2 can be mineralized and sequestered in solid form by various techniques, i.e., ex-situ, surficial and in situ mineralization. Ex situ and surficial approaches may produce valuable products while mitigating environmental hazards. In-situ mineralization uses ultramafic and mafic geological formations for permanent, solid storage. In addition, the IPCC portfolio that limits warming to <2°C by 2100 includes avoiding CO2 emissions and removal of CO2 from air. Regardless of the specific mix of approaches, it will be essential to permanently sequester about 10 billion tons of CO2 per year by mid-century, and roughly twice that amount each year by 2100. Maximizing the potential of technologies for CO2 removal from air and CO2 storage will help to meet global climate goals. The research agenda published by National Academies of Sciences Engineering Medicine (2019) calls for roughly $1 billion over a 10–20 years time period to advance the deployment of CO2 sequestration in deep sedimentary reservoirs at the GtCO2/yr scale and develop CO2 mineralization at the MtCO2/yr scale. This would lead to a deeper understanding of the reservoir characteristics from the nano- to kilometer scale, some of which may include the distribution of the reaction products, the reaction rate of the minerals, the permeability evolution, the pressure build-up in the reservoir, the large-scale impact of chemicophysical processes leading to clogging or cracking, the effects of potential geochemical contamination, etc. This overview presents the advantages, drawbacks, costs, and CO2 storage potential of each technique, the current and future projects in this domain, and potential sequestration options in geologic formations around the world.",

		"abstract": "In situ mineral carbonation is facilitated by aqueous-phase chemical reactions with dissolved CO2. Evidence from the laboratory and the field shows that the limiting factors for in situ mineral carbonation are the dissolution rate of CO2 into the aqueous phase and the release rate of divalent cations from basic silicate minerals. Up to now, pilot CO2 storage projects and commercial operations have focused on the injection and storage of anthropogenic CO2 as a supercritical phase in depleted oil and gas reservoirs or deep saline aquifers with limited potential for CO2 mineralization. The CarbFix Pilot Project will test the feasibility of in situ mineral carbonation in basaltic rocks as a way to permanently and safely store CO2. The test includes the capture of CO2 flue gas from the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant and the injection of 2200 tons of CO2 per year, fully dissolved in water, at the CarbFix pilot injection site in SW Iceland. This paper describes the design of the CO2 injection test and the novel approach for monitoring and verification of CO2 mineralization in the subsurface by tagging the injected CO2 with radiocarbon (14C), and using SF5CF3 and amidorhodamine G as conservative tracers to monitor the transport of the injected CO2 charged water.",

Storage capacity for CO2 in such formations below the ocean floor is shown to vary with seafloor depth, geothermal gradient, porosity, and pore water salinity. The formation permeability, or the successful engineering of such permeability through hydraulic fracturing, will determine the capacity for gravitational trapping in deep-sea geological formations. We conclude that most ocean sediments at appropriate depth will lack the required permeability and that conventional hydraulic fracturing would only be possible in carefully selected sites.",

We appraise the cross-border prospectivity of the outer and central Faroe–Shetland, Møre and southern Vøring basins and present insights from extensive new 3D seismic surveys. Regional seismic surfaces are used to compile a cross-border seismic profile highlighting key discoveries from the UK Rosebank field in the SW to the Norwegian Ormen Lange field in the NE. Cretaceous to Paleocene reservoirs remain the main exploration focus seaward of the platform areas, and the presence of several large untested structures presents important exploration targets in the mid-Norway region. Improved imaging of the areas affected by Paleogene igneous rocks reveals major untested sub-basalt structures including some regions on the marginal highs where the basalt cover has been entirely removed by erosion, revealing sub-basalt stratigraphy and structures with pre-Cretaceous potential prospectivity. The influence of igneous rocks on both discovered and prospective hydrocarbon systems is discussed. Neogene sand injectite fields and Quaternary glacial sand bodies are extremely well imaged in the Møre Basin, documenting shallow prospectivity supported by the presence of successful regional analogue plays. New 3D seismic data are revealing previously unseen prospectivity in frontier and underexplored regions.",

		"abstract": "The opening of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea at the Paleocene−Eocene transition was accompanied by extensive magmatic activity, giving rise to the North Atlantic Igneous Province. The magmatic activity is today manifested along the conjugate Norwegian and Greenland continental margins. In 2014, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate targeted a unit seen as prograding reflectors in the seismic record along the outer mid-Norwegian Margin by drilling. Approximately 40 m of igneous rocks were recovered from the shallow borehole 6403/1-U-1 at the northernmost part of the Møre Marginal High. This study presents the first documentation of ignoeus rocks from this poorly studied part of the Norwegian Margin. Based on detailed logging, petrographic and geochemical analyses, and interpretation of seismic lines over the study area, the study ads new elements to the understanding of the magmatic evolution of the Norwegian Margin. It is documented that the volcanic succession consists of brecciated material, comprising hyaloclastite and incorporated microcrystalline basalt clasts, and interlayered coherent lava flows. These are interpreted to represent the deposits formed during the build-out of a lava delta system. The findings confirm that the prograding reflectors have a volcanic origin. The cored volcanic succession has relatively uniform petrography and geochemistry, and it is exclusively composed of tholeiitic basalts with a MORB-like character. The basalts show affinities to other igneous rocks from the Vøring Marginal High, SE Greenland Margin and Jan Mayen Ridge, emplaced during the rift-to-drift transition. Geochemical modelling of rare earth elements, and of Nd and Hf isotopic compositions, along with enrichment in selective incompatible elements, provide evidence that the succession has experienced crustal contamination. Based on geochemical modelling, the melts are interpreted to originate from a mantle source more depleted than typical N-MORB sources. Seismic evidence reveals that the succession formed prior to ~56 Ma, probably in the Late Paleocene.",

Here the Carboniferous stratigraphy exhibits intervals of paleokarst breccias formed by gypsum dissolution. In this study we integrate digital outcrop models (DOMs) with a 2D ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey to extrapolate external irregular paleokarst geometries beyond the 2D outcrops. DOMs are obtained through combining a series of overlapping photographs with structure-from-motion photogrammetry, to create mm- to dm-resolution georeferenced DOMs. GPR is typically used for surveying the shallow subsurface and relies on detecting the contrasts in electro-magnetic permittivity. We defined three geophysical facies based on their appearance in GPR. By integrating subsurface geophysical data with DOMs we were able to correlate reflection patterns in GPR with outcrop features. The chaotic nature of paleokarst breccias is seen both in outcrop and GPR. Key horizons in outcrop and the GPR profiles allow tying together observations between these methods. Furthermore, we show that this technique expands the two-dimensional outcrop surface into a three-dimensional domain, thus complementing, strengthening and extending outcrop interpretations.",

		"abstract": "The study presents the methodology used by the French Geological Survey (BRGM) for the building, reprocessing and interpretation of selected regional seismic lines in the Paris intracratonic basin (France): the 14 constructed E–W and N–S regional transects represent a total of 2,516 km length, and are based on the merge of 240 seismic single profiles recorded by petroleum operators between 1971 and 1995. The regional lines have been selected to cross the main oil fields of the Paris Basin, as well as high potential areas for oil exploration. A first difficulty was to recover the raw data necessary to build-up the regional transects. The signal reprocessing, harmonization and merge of the single seismic lines, constituent of the regional transects, are then described; these operations represent the cornerstone of the study. We put the emphasis on the primary static corrections, as the targeted structures are commonly spatially associated with large seismic velocity variations in the upper Cretaceous chalk and Tertiary sedimentary cover. The interpreted regional transects definitely give complementary information to the existing studies, which generally lack seismic (and therefore structural) data: we give an overview of the main structural and geometrical features of the Paris Basin: inversion structures, major unconformities, as well as Permo-Carboniferous basins. We also describe the structural pattern, and show the close relationships between the faults geometry, the faults density, and the geological evolution of the Paris Basin: we distinguish (1) few large-scale polyphase faults, with a Variscan origin, representing the first order structural frame of the Paris Basin; (2) monophase normal faults, with strike-slip features, representing the subsurface prolongation of Cenozoic grabens cropping out in the neighbourhood; (3) deep normal faults, sealed by the base Calcareous Dogger sequence, related to the Permo-Liassic extensional tectonic regime. This large-scale view of the Paris Basin has highlighted several potential exploration targets.",

		"abstract": "A belt of folded and faulted Carboniferous-Cretaceous platform cover strata lies parallel to and inland of much of Spitsbergen's west coast. Uplifted older basement rocks along the coast have been thrust eastward into and over these younger platform cover strata. This deformation occurred in early Tertiary time and was related to dextral movement of the Barents Shelf past northeastern Greenland during the opening of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. On Midterhuken, a peninsula in Bellsund, an uplifted, tilted, and faulted sequence of the cover strata forms a 3.3-km-thick, 12-km-wide margin on the eastern side of the basement crustal welt. A series of closely spaced detachment horizons within Triassic strata occurs at the boundary between a lower unit of mainly sandstones and an upper unit of mainly thin-bedded shales and siltstones. The lower unit is tilted 60°–70° to the northeast but unfolded, whereas the upper unit is tightly and disharmonically folded. Hanging-wall–down movements on these and other detachment surfaces are indicated by offset of a dike and by fold-and-fault patterns. These foreland-dipping faults might be southwest-dipping thrusts later rotated, but more likely these faults and associated folds represent detachment structures formed close to their present position in response to the uplift and tilting of these strata.",

		"abstract": "Fault damage zones can act as a preferential corridor for fluid flow in the subsurface, and for this reason the characterization of their structure, including the attributes of the associated fracture network, is fundamental. In this work, we characterize the damage zone of the Qala fault, a normal fault developed in platform carbonates of the Gozo Island (Maltese Islands). We propose a new workflow that combines scanline and scan-area analysis applied on a high resolution DOM. Linear scanlines allow to characterize fracture spatial distribution, detect stationary area and identify damage zone width. Areal sampling permits to extract the fracture parameters matching the stationary 1D domains. This new approach allows us to: (1) univocally separate the damage zone from the background fractures, (2) identify fracture corridors, (3) collect fracture parameters (length, trend, density, intensity, spacing and topology), (4) identify the REV of the fracture density, intensity and topology and (5) characterize the fracture network connectivity.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, fracture-controlled (hydrothermal) dolomitization in association with igneous activity has gained interest in hydrocarbon exploration. The geometry and distribution of dolomite bodies in this setting are of major importance for these new plays. The Latemar platform presents a spectacularly exposed outcrop analogue for carbonate reservoirs affected by igneous activity and dolomitization.Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) scanning and digital outcrop models (DOMs) of outcrops offer a great opportunity to derive geometrical information. Only a few analysis methods exist to quantitatively assess huge amounts of georeferenced three-dimensional lithology data. This study presents a novel quantitative approach to describe three-dimensional spatial variation of lithology derived from DOMs. This approach is applied to the Latemar platform to determine dolomite body geometry and distribution in relation to crosscutting dikes.A high-resolution photorealistic DOM of the Latemar platform allows description of dolomite occurrences in three dimensions, with high precision at platform scale. This results in a unique lithology dataset of limestone, dolomite, and dike positions. This dataset is analyzed by true three-dimensional variography for the geospatial description of dolomite distribution. In most studies, three-dimensional geostatistics is the combination of two-dimensional horizontal and one-dimensional vertical variation. In this study, the dolomite occurrences are extensive in three dimensions and cannot be reduced to a two-dimensional + one-dimensional case. Therefore, the concept of two-dimensional variogram maps is expanded to a three-dimensional description of lithology variation. Three-dimensional anisotropy detection is used to derive principal directions in the occurrence of dolomite.Two small-scale (&lt;200 m [656 ft]) anisotropy directions emerge, one vertical and one subhorizontal, which describe the geometry of the dolomite bodies. These principal directions are perfectly aligned parallel to the average dike orientation. On platform scale (200–1600 m [656–5249 ft]) a bedding-parallel anisotropy direction indicates stratigraphic control on dolomite occurrences.",

		"abstract": "A subsurface reservoir model is a computer based representation of petrophysical parameters such a porosity, permeability, fluid saturation, etc. Given that direct measurement of these parameters is limited to a few wells it is necessary to extrapolate their distribution. As geology is a first order control on petrophysics, it follows that an understanding of facies and their distribution is central to predicting reservoir quality and architecture. The majority of reservoir modelling systems used for the subsurface are based on correlation of seismically-derived surfaces to define reservoir zones. Well data are then used to define further, sub-seismic scale horizons and determine the zone properties which are represented in grid cells. Understanding the distribution of both sub-seismic surfaces and potential heterogeneous geology between them remains a significant challenge. Furthermore as the typical grid cell size is c. 50-200 m2 it is challenging to incorporate small-scale heterogeneities. It is critical, therefore, to use realistic values for both key stratigraphic horizons and internal facies distributions. Depositional facies is a fundamental control on petrophysics. However, facies scale heterogeneities are not resolvable using current seismic methods, and well data provide little or no data on 3D geometries beyond the well bore. Studies of modern sedimentary events can give some indication of the link between depositional processes and facies distribution (e.g., Kenyon et al., 1995); however preserved depositional architecture is also strongly controlled by changes in accommodation through time (Jervey, 1988). Laboratory-based experiments (e.g., Kneller &amp; Buckee, 2000) and process-based modelling (e.g. Aigner et al., 1989; Peakall et al., 2000) further illustrate the link between depositional mechanism and facies architecture. However, such models are typically on a scale that is far smaller than the typical field and are more applicable to upscaling studies (Nordhal et al., 2005; Ringrose et al., 2005). Outcrop studies have long been employed as a mechanism of studying analogues and understanding petroleum fields (Collinson, 1970; Glennie, 1970; Breed &amp; Grow, 1979). Once the type of depositional system and the accommodation history of a hydrocarbon field are derived from subsurface data, appropriate outcrop analogue(s) can then be identified (e.g. Alexander, 1993). Suitable analogues are those that are geologically comparable to the system that is being studied and also have excellent 3D outcrop exposure over an area that is large enough to capture the scale of heterogeneity required (Clark &amp; Pickering, 1996). Outcrop analogue studies are thus a key way of improving understanding of reservoir facies architecture, geometry, and facies distributions. Outcrop analogue studies have been undertaken both qualitatively and more recently quantitatively. Traditional quantitative studies (e.g., Dreyer et al., 1993; Chapin et al., 1994; Bryant &amp; Flint, 1993; Clark &amp; Pickering, 1996; Reynolds, 1999) have been focused on the collection of outcrop data to populate inter-well reservoir model areas by stochastic, object-based methods (Floris &amp; Peersmann, 2002). However, it can be difficult to extract usable data from traditional outcrop studies, especially when it needs to be integrated with petroleum engineering databases or to be visualized in 3D. Furthermore, outcrops which represent a topographic cut through solid geology are 2D and while rare examples show multiple sections through the solid geology with different orientations, geological expertise is still required to fully understand and interpret the 3D nature of the bodies. Such work may also need geostatistical data manipulation to overcome outcrop orientation and size issues (Geehan &amp; Underwood, 1993; Vissa &amp; Chessa, 2000) but ideally the data should be reconstructed in 3D. Accurate 3D reconstruction is the only way that parameters such as channel sinuosity, connectivity, and continuity of target sandbodies in 3D may be defined. Such parameters are a key control on hydrocarbon production, including sweep efficiency (Pringle et al., 2004a; Larue &amp; Friedmann, 2005). Software for representing geology in 3D is routinely used to model subsurface reservoirs. This paper will show how recent digital data capture technique advances aids the interpreting reservoir geologist by obtaining accurate and quantitative outcrop analogue datasets to aid and perhaps modify his reservoir model.",

		"abstract": "Terrestrial laser scanning, or lidar, is a recent innovation in spatial information data acquisition, which allows geological outcrops to be digitally captured with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. With point precisions and spacing of the order of a few centimetres, an enhanced quantitative element can now be added to geological fieldwork and analysis, opening up new lines of investigation at a variety of scales in all areas of field-based geology. Integration with metric imagery allows 3D photorealistic models to be created for interpretation, visualization and education. However, gaining meaningful results from lidar scans requires more than simply acquiring raw point data. Surveys require planning and, typically, a large amount of post-processing time. The contribution of this paper is to provide a more detailed insight into the technology, data collection and utilization techniques than is currently available. The paper focuses on the workflow for using lidar data, from the choice of field area and survey planning, to acquiring and processing data and, finally, extracting geologically useful data. Because manufacturer specifications for point precision are often optimistic when applied to real-world outcrops, the error sources associated with lidar data, and the implications of them propagating through the processing chain, are also discussed.",

		"abstract": "Skip to Next Section\nStudies of large-scale sedimentary architecture are mainly based on the interpretation of two-dimensional photomosaics. This method cannot account for the natural rugosity of outcrop exposures, introducing errors in the measurement of geobody sizes and orientations. In the past, three-dimensional outcrop studies have relied on time-intensive fieldwork, with irregular sampling and low geometric accuracy. More recently, terrestrial laser scanning, or LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), has been widely applied to small-scale outcrops, but range and accessibility preclude its usage on larger-scale outcrops. Oblique helicopter-based laser scanning, however, allows the collection of tens of kilometres of outcrop sections in a relatively short time frame. In this paper, a procedure for collecting and processing such virtual outcrop data is outlined, and the application of the technique for extracting dimensions of fluvial geobodies from two large and otherwise inaccessible outcrops from Utah is presented. The results are compared to interpretations from more conventional photomosaicking of the same outcrops. Results show that the use of helicopter-based laser scanning enables geoscientists to rapidly acquire georeferenced data that can then be used for sedimentological interpretation and analysis on reservoir scales. It is concluded that helicopter-based laser scanning promotes sedimentological research and is well suited to capturing quantitative geometrical data from large outcrops.",

Outcrop analogue studies provide quantitative information pertinent to sealing capacity and help constrain fluid migration modelling and risk assessment. We present an integrated characterization of the Agardhfjellet Formation. The mudstone-dominated, heavily faulted caprock sequence crops out near Janusfjellet, central Spitsbergen, approximately 15 kilometres north of the Longyearbyen CO2 Lab well park where the formation has been fully cored through four boreholes. Time-equivalent Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous stratigraphic intervals are widespread across the Barents Sea and Norwegian continental shelf, acting as both prolific source rocks and top seals of several hydrocarbon fields. We supplement the Longyearbyen CO2 Lab’s archive of drill cores, borehole and multiphysical data with a high-resolution outcrop model and ERT/IP data to ascertain seal quality of the heavily faulted caprock. The outcrop model features sub-decimeter root-mean-square-errors and a sub-centimeter resolution, capturing the exposed faults and fractures in full. Cross-cutting faults are observed, offset by as much as 8.5 meters, and fault core architecture change considerably throughout the section. Fault core architecture observations correlate with electrical resistivity tomography and induced polarization results., further constraining fault architecture into the subsurface.",

		"abstract": "[Abstract Fault‐controlled mixed siliciclastic‐carbonate‐evaporite depositional systems exhibit distinct sensitivity to tectonic and eustatic controls that are expressed in the sedimentary architecture. In the Upper Carboniferous Billefjorden Trough (Svalbard, Norway), up to 2,000 m of a warm and arid climate syn‐rift basin fill comprises such depositional systems, documented in this study with traditional field techniques supported by helicopter‐ and ground‐based LIDAR models. The basin evolved from siliciclastics‐dominated red beds and paralic units that filled a symmetrical basin, to a rift climax half‐graben with alluvial fans entering the basin along relay ramps of the master fault zone (Billefjorden fault zone). Faults located in the hanging wall dip‐slope prevented the progradation of coarser material to the eastern part of the basin. Later, structural reorganisation in the dipslope led to the cessation of easternmost faults with deformation focusing along one major lineament (Løvehovden fault zone) antithetic to the master fault zone. The basin subsidence became more symmetrical, with main central depocentre and shallower platforms near the basin flanks. Footwall anticlines from faults displacement gradients were sensitive to periodical exposure and recorded dissolution breccias and footwall synclines preserved evaporites coupled with shallow marine siliciclastic deposits. Concurrently, thick gypsum/anhydrite deposits in the basin centre reflect glacio‐eustatic lowstands, whereas evenly thick carbonate deposition characterises highstands. While most analysis of syn‐rift basin fill is based on siliciclastics deposits, we here demonstrate the complexity of tectonism versus eustatic sea level changes in a mixed carbonate‐evaporite syn‐rift deposits. Tectonic influence is ascribed to the deposition of alluvial fans that prograded from the master fault towards the basin centre. On the dipslope glacio‐eustatic signals outperformed tectonic influence on deposition. Sea level lowstands promoted deposition of red sabkha mudstones and gypsum/anhydrite, salinas evaporites or dissolution breccias, interbedded with highstand carbonate beds., The evolution of the subsidence in the Billefjorden Trough shown by symmetrical early syn‐rift phase followed by asymmetrical rift climax phase. The late syn‐rift reorganization phase is highlighted by the progressive cessation the faults on the dipslope and deformation focusing in the central part of the basin. ]",

Here the Carboniferous stratigraphy exhibits intervals of paleokarst breccias formed by gypsum dissolution. In this study we integrate digital outcrop models (DOMs) with a 2D ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey to extrapolate external irregular paleokarst geometries beyond the 2D outcrops. DOMs are obtained through combining a series of overlapping photographs with structure-from-motion photogrammetry, to create mm- to dm-resolution georeferenced DOMs. GPR is typically used for surveying the shallow subsurface and relies on detecting the contrasts in electro-magnetic permittivity. We defined three geophysical facies based on their appearance in GPR. By integrating subsurface geophysical data with DOMs we were able to correlate reflection patterns in GPR with outcrop features. The chaotic nature of paleokarst breccias is seen both in outcrop and GPR. Key horizons in outcrop and the GPR profiles allow tying together observations between these methods. Furthermore, we show that this technique expands the two-dimensional outcrop surface into a three-dimensional domain, thus complementing, strengthening and extending outcrop interpretations.",

		"abstract": "SfM/MVS photogrammetry has received increasing attention due to its convenience, broadening the range of its applications into archaeology and anthropology. Because the accuracy of SfM/MVS depends on photography, one important issue is that incorrect or low-density point clouds are found in 3D models due to poor overlapping between images. A systematic way of taking photographs solve these problems, though it has not been well established and the accuracy has not been examined either, with some exceptions. The present study aims to (i) develop an efficient method for recording pottery using an automated turntable and (ii) assess its accuracy through a comparison with 3D models made by laser scanning. We recorded relatively simple pottery manufactured by prehistoric farmers in the Japanese archipelago using SfM/MVS photogrammetry and laser scanning. Further, by measuring the Hausdorff distance between 3D models made using these two methods, we show that their difference is negligibly small, suggesting that our method is sufficiently accurate to record pottery.",

Over the course of almost 3 months, the volcano produced profound morphological changes in the landscape affecting both the natural and the anthropic environment over an area of tens of km2. We present the results of a UAS (Unoccupied Aircraft System) survey consisting of >12,000 photographs coupled with Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry that allowed us to produce a very-high-resolution (0.2 m/pixel) Digital Surface Model (DSM). We characterised the surface topography of the newly formed volcanic landforms and produced an elevation difference map by differencing our survey and a pre-event surface, identifying morphological changes in detail.

However, developing models with these characteristics remains challenging. Here, we present a dataset corresponding to a renowned tectonic entity in the Swiss Alps - the Nappe de Morcles - that does achieve these criteria. Locations of lithological interfaces and formation orientations were first extracted from existing sources. Then, using state-of-the-art algorithms, the interfaces were interpolated. Finally, an iterative process of evaluation and re-interpolation was undertaken. The geology was satisfactorily reproduced; modelled interfaces correspond well with the input data, and the estimated volumes seem plausible. Overall, 18 formations, including their associated secondary folds and selected faults, are represented at 10 m resolution. Numerous environmental investigations in the study area could benefit from the dataset; indeed, it is already informing integrated hydrological (snow/surface-water/groundwater) simulations. Our work demonstrates the potential that now exists to develop complex, high-quality geological models in support of contemporary Alpine research, augmenting traditional geological information in the process.",

Characterization of these elements is fundamental to understanding and quantifying sandstone body connectivity within hydrocarbon reservoir models, and hence improving recovery from those reservoirs being modeled. This study utilized a laterally and vertically continuous terrestrial light detection and ranging (lidar) data set from the La Serrata section of the Oligocene–Miocene Huesca fluvial fan, in the Ebro Basin in Spain. This data set was used to create a high-resolution three-dimensional digital outcrop model of a 2 km2 cliff section representing the heterogeneity in the medial (midfan) portion of a large fluvial fan. Geostatistical information (i.e., sandstone body width and thickness) extracted from the models using quantitative analytical techniques, integrated with traditional sedimentary log data, allowed the calculation of probability density functions of 42 sandstone bodies from corrected (true) width measurements. These data show that sandstone bodies are up to 6 m thicker and 209 m wider than previous studies have estimated. Furthermore, an observed temporal trend of thickening and widening of sandstone bodies up section before a reduction in the uppermost portion provides evidence for possible avulsion events. These data, compared with previous studies of this and other fluvial systems, illustrate the efficacy of digital outcrop models as quantitative tools for accurate characterization of critical reservoir elements from outcrop analogues.",

		"abstract": "Broadband (0.001–1000s) magnetotelluric (MT) data along a crooked profile collected to investigate the geothermal potential on Spitsbergen could not be fully explained by two-dimensional (2D) models; hence we interpret the data with three-dimensional (3D) inversion herein. To better accommodate 3D features and nearby off profile resistivity structures, the full MT impedance tensor data together with the tipper were inverted. As a model control, a detailed bathymetry is systematically incorporated in the inversion. Our results from testing different inversion settings emphasised that appropriately choosing and tuning the starting model, data error floor and the model regularization together are crucial to obtain optimum benefit from MT field data. Through the 3D inversion, we reproduced out of quadrant impedance components and obtained an overall satisfactory data fit (RMS=1.05). The final 3D resistivity model displays a complex geology of the near surface region (<1.5km), which suggests fractures, localized and regional fault systems and igneous intrusions in the Mesozoic platform cover deposits. The Billefjorden fault zone is revealed as a consistent and deep rooted (>2km) conductive anomaly, confirming the regional nature of the fault. The fault zone is positioned between two uplifted basement blocks (>1000Ωm) of presumably pre-Devonian (Caledonian) metamorphic rocks, and the fault may have been responsible for deformation in the overlying Paleozoic-Mesozoic unit. Upper crustal conductive anomalies (<10Ωm) below the Paleozoic-Mesozoic succession in the western part of the 3D model are interpreted as part of a Devonian basin fill. These conductors are laterally and vertically bounded by resistive rocks, suggesting a conducive environment for deep geothermal heat storage. Having this scenario in an area of a known high heat-flow, deep faults and a thinned lithosphere makes the hypothesis on finding a technologically exploitable geothermal resource close to human settlement in the area stronger.",

Combining the two EM data sets enabled to resolve the electrical resistivity structure of the target site better than either of the methods alone. 2D inverting the MT data in the audio period interval (0.003–1s) with supporting input derived from the TEM data (0.01–10ms) provided a geologically meaningful resistivity model that included information not previously evident from existing seismic and borehole data. The ca. 1.8×1km 2D resistivity model displays a laterally constrained highly conductive anomaly (ca. 10Ωm) at about 400–500m depth, where reflectors of a parallel seismic section are concealed and core samples indicate a highly fractured décollement zone formed during Paleogene compression. The base of the permafrost is imaged at ca. 200m depth. Synthetic inversion tests, however, suggest that this may be exaggerated by tens of meters, due to a thin conductive layer present approximately between 10 and 25m depth. The resistivity model does not give indication for a fluid pathway we can connect to leakage, in line with water injection and leak-off tests in the reservoir and cap-rock, both of which indicate a sealing shale-dominated cap-rock separating an over-pressured compartment above the sealing shale from a severely under-pressured reservoir interval. The results we present indicate the advantage of integrating EM exploration techniques in a CO2 reservoir-cap-rock study to obtain a more complete picture.",

		"abstract": "Fault activity and sandstone-body geometries and spread, all bear significant weight to understanding the potential hydrocarbon systems on the NW Barents Shelf. Synthetic seismic modelling of onshore sedimentary successions provides insight into the seismic resolution and expression of various sedimentological features on Edgeøya: (i) sandy growth basins in pro-delta mudstones (ii) paralic sedimentary deposits and (iii) low-angle tidally influenced progradational successions. Synthetic modelling suggests that the lithological contrast associated with sand-infilled growth basins in pro-deltaic shales, even with offsets as small as 50–75 m, will create distinct geometries in seismic data. Modelling suggests that while optimal 90° illumination, low frequency bands and more typical sedimentary velocities around 2000 m/s will generate very clear discernible growth faults, the angular lithological contrast should generate discernible features even with the high velocities and typical 20–30 Hz frequency band of seismic sections on the NW Barents Shelf. Comparing to actual seismic data in which multiples, noise and in places overburden are influential, it is possible to identify growth-fault geometries more confidently, and to link them to larger planar fault activity. Modelling other features identified in the paralic sedimentary system it is apparent that many of the massive channel or lenticular shaped sandstone bodies should be identifiable in the actual seismic, although their expression is less distinct and more easily misinterpreted than that of growth faults. It is apparent that features such as igneous intrusions, unless imaged in a “perfect” survey, can be difficult to properly identify, particularly near-vertical connections. The velocity contrast creates strong impedance along horizontal sections, but heavily fractured igneous intrusions with lower velocities could easily be assumed to be isolated sandstone bodies. While the modelling appreciates the overall wedging nature of the successions, the simplified lithological observations onshore cannot predict the probable erosion/condensation contrast associated with low-angle clinoforms which are visible in the seismic data, and hence not reproduce them easily in the models.",

		"abstract": "Stora magmatiska provinser återfinns långt tillbaka i jordens geologiska historia, från Arkeikum till Kenozoikum, och kan ha en stor påverkan på det globala klimatet. Den hög-arktiska stora magmatiska provinsen (HALIP) bildades under tidig Krita och rester av denna storskaliga magmatism kan observeras i hela Arktis. Relativt få U-Pb åldrar har än så länge blivit analyserade och mer geokronologisk data, såväl som detaljerade petrologiska och geokemiska studier behövs för att få en bättre förståelse för utvecklingen av denna stora magmatiska provins. HALIP har studerats i detalj på Kanadas arktiska öar, till skillnad från de relativt outforskade intrusionerna i Svalbard, som kollektivt kallas för ”Diabasodden Suite”. För att minska kunskapsluckorna gällande HALIPs bildande i Svalbard, så gjordes en fältundersökning i Ekmanfjorden under hösten 2020 för att samla in bergartsprover och drönarbilder. Ekmanfjorden ligger i norra Isfjorden, i Spetsbergen, och är till största del outforskad när det gäller HALIP. Tidigare fältundersökningar i Isfjorden har på avstånd sett att det finns flera okarterade intrusioner i Ekmanfjorden som behövs undersökas. Bergartsproverna som samlades in under 2020 har använts till geokemiska analyser, både på hela prover och enskilda mineral, och tunnslip har gjorts för petrologiska studier. Drönarbilderna har använts till att göra virtuella modeller över intrusionerna, för att beräkna volymen av de magmatiska bergarterna samt för att uppdatera den geologiska kartan över området. Geometrin av bergarterna har också undersökts med hjälp av dessa bilder, och den tillgängliga geokronologiska datan har granskats för att kunna jämföra den nya datan med HALIP i stort. Resultaten visar att volymen av de intrusiva resterna som kan observeras i Ekmanfjorden är mellan 0.25 och 0.52 km3 och geometrin indikerar att de magmatiska bergarterna som återfinns på den huvudsakliga halvön kan ha intruderats som en stor sammanhängande intrusion, med en volym på åtminstone 3.6 km3. Den geokemiska signaturen från Ekmanfjordens magmatiska bergarter korrelerar väl med andra HALIP intrusioner med ungefär samma ålder runt on i Arktis. Intrusionerna in Ekmanfjorden består av basaltiska toleiiter som visar omfattande kontamination från jordskorpan och en ursprunglig magma lik berikade basalter från mittoceaniska ryggar. Geokemiska analyser på bergartsproverna indikerar att intrusionerna i Ekmanfjorden har en komplex historia, med två separata magmapulser. En av pulserna tyder på tidig smältning av låg grad i granatstabilitetsfältet kombinerad med senare grundare smältning i spinellstabilitetsfältet, medan den andra vanligare pulsen indikerar endast smältning djupare i manteln, i närvaro av granat. För att förstå vilken av dessa två pulser kom först så behövs U-Pb geokronologi med hög precision. Det finns även ett stort behov av mer U-Pb geokronologi av HALIP i hela Svalbard och Arktis, då det idag endast finns 4 U-Pb åldrar tillgängliga från Svalbard och totalt endast 23 U-Pb åldrar av HALIP i hela Arktis.",

The aim has been to generate an updated depositional model and link this to controlling factors. The more than kilometer thick progradational succession includes the offshore shales of the Gilsonryggen Member of the Frysjaodden Formation, the shallow marine sandstones of the Battfjellet Formation and the predominantly heterolithic Aspelintoppen Formation, together recording the progressive eastwards infill of the foredeep flanking the West Spitsbergen fold‐and‐thrust belt. Here we present a summary of the paleo‐environmental depositional systems across the basin, their facies and regional distribution and link these together in an updated depositional model. The basin‐margin system prograded with an ascending shelf‐edge trajectory in the order of 1°. The basin fill was bipartite, with offset stacked shelf and shelf‐edge deltas, slope clinothems and basin floor fans in the western and deepest part and a simpler architecture of stacked shelf‐deltas in the shallower eastern part. We suggest a foredeep setting governed by flexural loading, likely influenced by buckling, and potentially developing into a wedge top basin in the mature stage of basin filling. High‐subsidence rates probably counteracted eustatic falls with the result that relative sea‐level falls were uncommon. Distance to the source terrain was small and sedimentation rates was temporarily high. Time‐equivalent deposits can be found outbound of Stappen High in the Vestbakken Volcanic Province and the Sørvestsnaget Basin 300 km further south on the Barents Shelf margin. We cannot see any direct evidence of coupling between these more southerly systems and the studied one; southerly diversion of the sediment‐routing, if any, may have taken place beyond the limit of the preserved deposits., The Svalbard Eocene‐Oligocene (?) foreland basin succession.

We report the results of an integrated scientific programme of well drilling and seismic acquisition that was initiated to supplement outcrop studies of clinoform development for educational and research purposes. The well, drilled in 2008, is 1085 m deep and a complete clinoform section of Eocene age has been cored. In 2009, 48 km of 2D seismic lines were acquired on the glaciers in the area using snowstreamer technology, with two of the seismic lines crossing the well location. The energy in the shallow window is dominated by direct waves, airwaves, and surface waves. Careful processing integrated with geological interpretation was necessary to image the Palaeogene clinoforms. Based on well and outcrop information and seismic facies, the Palaeogene clinoform succession may be divided into four main units: basin floor shales, sandy bottomsets, slope to basin floor clinoforms, and topsets. We now have a complete dataset containing outcrops, cores, wireline logs, and seismic data for research, education, and to build geological models in a basin floor to shelf setting. It can be used as an analogue for exploration worldwide.",

		"abstract": "Storage capacity is a key aspect when validating potential CO2 sequestration sites. Most CO2 storage projects, for obvious reasons, target conventional aquifers (e.g., saline aquifers, depleted hydrocarbon fields) with good reservoir properties and ample subsurface data. However, non-geological factors, such as proximity to the CO2 source, may require storing CO2 in geologically “less-than-ideal” sites. We here present a first-order CO2 storage resource estimate of such an unconventional storage unit, a naturally fractured, compartmentalized and underpressured siliciclastic aquifer located at 670–1,000 m below Longyearbyen, Arctic Norway. Water injection tests confirm the injectivity of the reservoir. Capacity calculations, based on the US DOE guidelines for CO2 storage resource estimation, were implemented in a stochastic volumetric workflow. All available data were used to specify input parameters and their probability distributions. The areal extent of the compartmentalized reservoir is poorly constrained, encouraging a scenario-based approach. Other high-impact parameters influencing storage resource estimates include CO2 saturation, CO2 density and the storage efficiency factor. The hydrodynamic effects of storing CO2 in a compartmentalized aquifer are accounted for by calculating probable storage efficiency factors (0.04–0.79 %) in a fully closed system. The results are ultimately linked to the chosen scenario, with two orders of magnitude difference between scenarios. The fracture network contributes with up to 2 % to the final volumes. The derived workflow validates CO2 storage sites based on initial feasibility assessments, and may be applied to aid decision making at other unconventional CO2 storage sites with significant data uncertainty.",

The area is characterised by steep alpine terrain with more than 2000 m of relief that in many places is completely inaccessible, which makes field work extremely difficult. Therefore 3D mapping using digital photogrammetry is an invaluable tool in the investigation of the region. Early geological investigations of the area involved the first use of photogrammetry in Greenland (Henderson &amp; Pulvertaft 1987). This contribution serves as an example of the present-day use of photogrammetry in geological interpretation, following the workflow outlined in Sørensen &amp; Dueholm (2018). During the last three years, more than 50&nbsp;000 stereo images have been collected using handheld, calibrated digital cameras while conducting field work in the area (Rosa et al. 2016, 2017, 2018). The images, which cover large parts of the steep cliff sections in which the geology is superbly exposed, are essential to the ongoing revision of the geological map sheets covering the area. Here we present a small subset of the data from the island of Karrat (Fig. 1), showcasing the potential of 3D geological mapping in Greenland as well as presenting new insights into the geology of the Karrat Group.",

		"abstract": "The accurate classification and 3D mapping of benthic habitats in coastal ecosystems are vital for developing management strategies for these valuable shallow water environments. However, both automatic and semiautomatic approaches for deriving ecologically significant information from a towed video camera system are quite limited. In the current study, we demonstrate a semiautomated framework for high-resolution benthic habitat classification and 3D mapping using Structure from Motion and Multi View Stereo (SfM-MVS) algorithms and automated machine learning classifiers. The semiautomatic classification of benthic habitats was performed using several attributes extracted automatically from labeled examples by a human annotator using raw towed video camera image data. The Bagging of Features (BOF), Hue Saturation Value (HSV), and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methods were used to extract these attributes from 3000 images. Three machine learning classifiers (k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and bagging (BAG)) were trained by using these attributes, and their outputs were assembled by the fuzzy majority voting (FMV) algorithm. The correctly classified benthic habitat images were then geo-referenced using a differential global positioning system (DGPS). Finally, SfM-MVS techniques used the resulting classified geo-referenced images to produce high spatial resolution digital terrain models and orthophoto mosaics for each category. The framework was tested for the identification and 3D mapping of seven habitats in a portion of the Shiraho area in Japan. These seven habitats were corals (Acropora and Porites), blue corals (H. coerulea), brown algae, blue algae, soft sand, hard sediments (pebble, cobble, and boulders), and seagrass. Using the FMV algorithm, we achieved an overall accuracy of 93.5% in the semiautomatic classification of the seven habitats.",

		"abstract": "Recent advances are made in earth surface reconstruction with high spatial resolution due to SfM photogrammetry. High flexibility of data acquisition and high potential of process automation allows for a significant increase of the temporal resolution, as well, which is especially interesting to assess geomorphic changes. Two case studies are presented where 4D reconstruction is performed to study soil surface changes at 15 seconds intervals: (a) a thunderstorm event is captured at field scale and (b) a rainfall simulation is observed at plot scale. A workflow is introduced for automatic data acquisition and processing including the following approach: data collection, camera calibration and subsequent image correction, template matching to automatically identify ground control points in each image to account for camera movements, 3D reconstruction of each acquisition interval, and finally applying temporal filtering to the resulting surface change models to correct random noise and to increase the reliability of the measurement of signals of change with low intensity. Results reveal surface change detection with cm- to mm-accuracy. Significant soil changes are measured during the events. Ripple and pool sequences become obvious in both case studies. Additionally, roughness changes and hydrostatic effects are apparent along the temporal domain at the plot scale. 4D monitoring with time-lapse SfM photogrammetry enables new insights into geomorphic processes due to a significant increase of temporal resolution.

		"abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> We use high-resolution aerial photogrammetry to investigate glacier retreat in great spatial and temporal detail in the Ötztal Alps, a heavily glacierized area in Austria. Long-term in situ glaciological observations are available for this region as well as a multitemporal time series of digital aerial images with a spatial resolution of 0.2 m acquired over a period of 9 years. Digital surface models (DSMs) are generated for the years 2009, 2015, and 2018. Using these, glacier retreat, extent, and surface elevation changes of all 23 glaciers in the region, including the Vernagtferner, are analyzed. Due to different acquisition dates of the large-scale photogrammetric surveys and the glaciological data, a correction is successfully applied using a designated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey across a major part of the Vernagtferner. The correction allows a comparison of the mass balances from geodetic and glaciological techniques – both quantitatively and spatially. The results show a clear increase in glacier mass loss for all glaciers in the region, including the Vernagtferner, over the last decade. Local deviations and processes, such as the influence of debris cover, crevasses, and ice dynamics on the mass balance of the Vernagtferner, are quantified. Since those local processes are not captured with the glaciological method, they underline the benefits of complementary geodetic surveying. The availability of high-resolution multi-temporal digital aerial imagery for most of the glaciers in the Alps provides opportunities for a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of climate-change-induced glacier retreat and mass loss.</p>",

		"abstract": "This paper presents (1) an automated method to extract planes and their spatial orientation directly from 3D point clouds, followed by (2) extensive validation tests accompanied by thorough statistical analysis, and (3) a fracture intensity calculation on automatically segmented planes. For the plane extraction, a region growing segmentation algorithm controlled by several input parameters is applied to a point cloud of a granite outcrop. Within its complex surface shape, more than 1000 compass measurements were conducted for validation. In addition, digitally handpicked planes in the software Virtual Reality Geological Studio (VRGS) were used for single plane comparison. In a second test site, we performed fracture intensity calculation in Petrel based on results of the segmentation algorithm on mechanical layers of a clastic sedimentary succession. The comparison of automated segmentation results and compass measurements of three different plane sets shows a deviation of 0.70–2.00°, while the mean single plane divergence amounts to 4.97°. Hence, this study presents a fast, precise, and highly adaptable automated plane detection method, which is reproducible, transparent, objective, and provides increased accuracy in outcrops with rough and complex surfaces. Moreover, output formats of spatial orientation and location of planes are designed for simple handling in other workflows and software.",

		"abstract": "Fractures rarely occur individually but more usually as networks of numerous fractures whose arrangement, abundance, and interaction control the mechanical and transport properties of rock masses. Of particular importance are the distributions and spatial variations of different geometric (locations, orientation, length, etc.) and topological (intersections, connectivity, etc.) attributes of fractures in a network. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) provide a means to map and digitize two-dimensional fracture networks from a variety of field and remote sensing data and to display the results in the form of quality maps. We introduce NetworkGT, an open-source toolbox for ArcGIS capable of efficient sampling, analysis, and spatial mapping of geometric and topological attributes of two-dimensional fracture networks. The toolbox helps to extract and plot geometric and topological information from a given two-dimensional fracture network including: rose diagrams, plots of frequency distribution and topology, and maps of topological parameters. Using a fracture network example from offshore NW Devon, United Kingdom, we illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the toolbox. This includes computing a contour grid with 1326 subsampled regions within the fracture network, which is used to demonstrate the quantitative capabilities of the toolbox and the ability to spatially map important network properties. The toolbox will help to facilitate the increasing application of geometry and topology in the analysis and comparison of fracture networks at a range of scales. Furthermore, the integration of the NetworkGT toolbox into ArcGIS allows two-dimensional fracture networks to be interpreted, mapped, and fully analyzed within the same software package.",

		"abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry has become an important tool for quantitative characterisation of outcrops. Digital outcrop models (DOMs) allow for the mapping of stratigraphy and discontinuous structures like folds, faults and fractures from cm to km scale and provide solutions that are difficult to constrain through subsurface data alone. With pristine, treeless exposures, the outcropping strata in Svalbard, Arctic Norway, hold exceptional potential for analogue studies and are ideally suited for the acquisition of high-resolution DOMs. We here present the acquisition, processing and integration of the Konusdalen West digital model data set, comprising both DOM and derived digital terrain model (DTM) data. Dronebased image acquisition took place over two weeks in July and August 2020. Fifteen differential GNSS control points were used to georeference and quality assure the model, five of which functioning as reference checkpoints. SfM processing of 5512 acquired images resulted in high-confidence, cm-scale resolution point clouds, textured mesh (DOM), tiled model, orthomosaics, and a DTM. The confidence-filtered dense cloud features a median inter-point distance of 1.57 cm and has an average point density of 3824.9 points m<sup>-2</sup>. For the five checkpoints, the dense cloud features root mean square errors of 2.0 cm in X, 1.3 cm in Y, 5.2 cm in Z, and 5.7 cm in XYZ. Drops in point confidence and point density are mainly found in areas with reduced image densities, and on the backside of boulders. Increased confidences and densities are present along the western flank of the Konusdalen West outcrop, where a fault-fracture network in mudstone-dominated stata is best exposed and photographed most extensively.</p> <p>The Konusdalen West DOM and DTM cover a 0.12 km<sup>2</sup> area and span a 170 m elevation difference. The mean of the altitude of the checkpoints versus elevation of the dense cloud-derived DTM differed by less than a cm. The dense cloud-derived DTM closely matches an existing lower-resolution reference DTM of the area. The DOM covers the upper two-third of the mudstonedominated Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Agardhfjellet Formation. The Agardhfjellet Formation and its time-equivalents are regional cap rocks for CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and petroleum accumulations both on the offshore Barents Shelf and onshore Svalbard. Faults, formation members and established marker beds can be traced in the high-resolution model and have been used for the stratigraphic integration. Additional structural measurements and observations were taken in June 2021 to place the data in the geological context. Top and side-view orthomosaics feature maximum resolutions of 8 mm per pixel, enabling the mapping of fractures and other sub-cm features. The Konusdalen West digital model data set, together with the extensive drill cores through the same section near Longyearbyen, forms an ideal starting point for the generation of high-resolution, outcrop-truthed geomodels that are suitable for numerical modelling of fluid flow and appraisal of the regionally important caprock.

		"abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become an interesting and active research topic for photogrammetry. Current research is based on images acquired by UAVs which have a high ground resolution and good spectral resolution due to low flight altitudes combined with a high-resolution camera. One of the main problems preventing full automation of data processing of UAV imagery is the unknown degradation effect of blur caused by camera movement during image acquisition. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the influence of blur on photogrammetric image processing. Images with precisely known motion blur were produced to determine the effect. It was found that even small blurs affect normal photogrammetric processes significantly. Although operator intervention might be time consuming, it can ensure that the results are still of acceptable accuracy.",

		"abstract": "Digital outcrop models (DOMs) have facilitated quantitative and qualitative studies in digital and virtual environments of source and reservoir rock analogs important to the oil industry. The use of immersive virtual reality (iVR) to extend field experiences has motivated several research groups to develop software integrating immersive virtual reality techniques with tools to interpret and derive geological information from DOMs. This virtual approach can also contribute to the development of geological and spatial thinking skills taught in the classroom and during field trips. The immersive virtual field trips (iVFTs) can provide students access to outcrops and additional data restricted to field learning activities while allowing additional interactions impossible in the field. iVFTs have been developed recently however the structuring of iVFTs for geology classes has not been presented in a way that inexperienced iVR users can make use of such systems. In this scenario, our work proposes a method to structure an iVFT using georeferenced data containers (GDCs) and the virtual reality software Mosis LAB while evaluating users' perceptions during an iVFT study case. The evaluation using technology acceptance model (TAM) questionnaires, showed that users were positively impacted by the observational iVFT experience, effectively supporting e-learning, and class field learning activities and preparations. This approach allows field trip experiences in less accessible study sites, especially in less favorable conditions like the ones during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic where many geoscience departments had their field trips hampered.",

		"type": "article-journal",
		"abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> We propose a newly developed modular MObile LIdar SENsor System (MOLISENS) to enable new applications for small industrial lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors. The stand-alone modular setup supports both monitoring of dynamic processes and mobile mapping applications based on SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms. The main objective of MOLISENS is to exploit newly emerging perception sensor technologies developed for the automotive industry for geoscientific applications. However, MOLISENS can also be used for other application areas, such as 3D mapping of buildings or vehicle-independent data collection for sensor performance assessment and sensor modeling. Compared to TLSs, small industrial lidar sensors provide advantages in terms of size (on the order of 10 <span class=\"inline-formula\">cm</span>), weight (on the order of 1 <span class=\"inline-formula\"> </span>kg or less), price (typically between EUR 5000 and 10 000), robustness (typical protection class of IP68), frame rates (typically 10–20 <span class=\"inline-formula\">Hz</span>), and eye safety class (typically 1). For these reasons, small industrial lidar systems can provide a very useful complement to currently used TLS (terrestrial laser scanner) systems that have their strengths in range and accuracy performance. The MOLISENS hardware setup consists of a sensor unit, a data logger, and a battery pack to support stand-alone and mobile applications. The sensor unit includes the small industrial lidar Ouster OS1-64 Gen1, a ublox multi-band active GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) with the possibility for RTK (real-time kinematic), and a nine-axis Xsens IMU (inertial measurement unit). Special emphasis was put on the robustness of the individual components of MOLISENS to support operations in rough field and adverse weather conditions. The sensor unit has a standard tripod thread for easy mounting on various platforms. The current setup of MOLISENS has a horizontal field of view of 360<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>∘</sup></span>, a vertical field of view with a 45<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>∘</sup></span> opening angle, a range of 120 m, a spatial resolution of a few centimeters, and a temporal resolution of 10–20 <span class=\"inline-formula\">Hz</span>. To evaluate the performance of MOLISENS, we present a comparison between the integrated small industrial lidar Ouster OS1-64 and the state-of-the-art high-accuracy and high-precision TLS Riegl VZ-6000 in a set of controlled experimental setups. We then apply the small industrial lidar Ouster OS1-64 in several real-world settings. The mobile mapping application of MOLISENS has been tested under various conditions, and results are shown from two surveys in the Lurgrotte cave system in Austria and a glacier cave in Longyearbreen on Svalbard.</p>",

		"abstract": "Magnetotelluric (MT) data allow for electrical resistivity probing of the Earth's subsurface. Integration of resistivity models in passive margin studies could help disambiguate non-unique interpretations of crustal composition derived from seismic and potential field data, a recurrent issue in the distal domain. In this contribution, we present the first marine MT data in the Barents Sea, derived from industrial controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveys. We characterize data quality, dimensionality, depth penetration and elaborate an analysis strategy. The extensive MT database consists of 337 receivers located along seven regional transects, emanating from ∼70 000 km2 of 3-D CSEM surveys acquired for hydrocarbon exploration from 2007 to 2019. High-quality MT data are extracted for periods ranging from 0.5 to 5000 s. The data show no apparent contamination by the active source nor effects related to large time-gaps in data collection and variable solar activity. Along receiver profiles, abrupt lateral variations of apparent resistivity and phase trends coincide with major structural boundaries and underline the geological information contained in the data. Dimensionality analysis reveals a dichotomy between the western domain of the SW Barents Sea, dominated by a single N–S electromagnetic strike and the eastern domain, with a two-fold, period-dependent strike. 35 receivers show 3-D distortion caused by nearby bathymetric slopes, evidenced by elevated skew values. We delineate geographical areas where the 2-D assumption is tenable and lay the foundation for future MT modelling strategies in the SW Barents Sea. We performed 2-D MT inversion along one of the regional transects, a ∼220-km-long, E–W profile encompassing a major structural high and sedimentary basin approaching the continent-ocean transition. The resistivity model reveals low crustal resistivity values (1–10 Ω.m) beneath the deep sedimentary basins, in marked contrast with high resistivity values (1000–5000 Ω.m) of the thick crystalline crust on the structural high. We interpret this abrupt lateral resistivity variation as a rapid transition from a thick, dry continental crust to a hyperextended and hydrated crustal domain. Integration of resistivity with seismic velocity, density and magnetic susceptibility models may further refine these structural models and the underlying tectonic processes in the SW Barents Sea margin. Our methodology is applicable globally where 3-D CSEM surveys are acquired and has a large potential for harvesting new knowledge on the electrical resistivity properties of the lithosphere.",

		"abstract": "The Troll and Jotun hot springs are located along the Bockfjorden fault zone at 79°23′N on Svalbard and represent the northernmost thermal springs documented on land. They are recharged through subpermafrost aquifers supplied mainly by glacial meltwater and derive their Ca and CO2 contents from Proterozoic marbles. Gases exsolved from the 25-28°C hot spring waters are N2 and CO2-dominated with high contents of He (reaching 1.5% in the Jotun springs) and Ar. The temperature distribution and temporal variation in the main Troll spring have been constrained by IR-photography and by temperature loggers embedded in the springs and associated, water-filled travertine pools over a period of one year. High-resolution micro-drilling techniques have allowed detailed stable isotope profiles to be obtained from selected travertine cross-sections. The data reflect seasonal fluctuations in temperatures during travertine growth and constrain the travertine growth rate. Most of the travertine growth occurs during the summer season as most of the flooded travertine pools were probably frozen for about 6 months per year. Oxygen isotope variations among the travertine terraces partly reflect fluctuations in the spring source composition. These fluctuations have been used to constrain the temporal evolution of the terrace system.",

		"abstract": "Along the Hornsund fault zone, South Spitsbergen (76°60’ N), thermokarstic springs smell of H2S and display either growth of, or eject fragments of, organic slime. The temperature in individual springs varies between 4 and 15°C. Their rate of discharge is ∼1 L s‐1 to 18 m3 s‐1, corresponding to a minimum temperature of 30°C within the base of the aquifer. The water, which contains a few ppm SO4 2‐, 0.5 ppm S2‐, and several thousand ppm NaCl, appears to be a mixture of turbid glacial melt water and hot brine. Water chemistry and stable isotopes indicate that the salinity is not the result of simple dilution of modern seawater from the brackish zone beneath the coastal karst aquifer, but rather originates from a deep thermal brine component where concentrations and isotopic composition of various species are controlled by water‐rock interaction in the source area of the brine. A value of δ34S of up to about 30‰ indicates that sulfide is a bioreduction product of sulfate. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies revealed bacteria and fungal hypha in the organic slime, and larger spherical particles (∼3.8 μm diameter) that display high concentrations of Fe and S. These findings demonstrate the presence of sutfate‐reducing bacteria within the sub‐permafrost aquifer.",

		"abstract": "Climate change is a significant concern for nature conservation in the 21 st century. One of the goals of the 2014 Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme is to identify the consequences of climate change for protected areas and to put in place adaptation or mitigation measures. As a contribution to the process, this paper develops a methodology to identify the relative level of risk to nationally and internationally important geological and geomorphological sites in Scotland from the impacts of climate change. The methodology is based on existing understanding of the likely responses of different types of geosite to specific aspects of climate change, such as changes in rainfall, rising sea levels or increased storminess, and is applied to assess the likelihood of damaging impacts on groups of similar geoheritage features in sites with similar characteristics. The results indicate that 80 (8.8%) of the ∼900 nationally and internationally important geoheritage sites in Scotland are at ‘high’ risk from climate change. These include active soft-sediment coastal and fluvial features, finite Quaternary sediment exposures and landforms in coastal and river locations, active periglacial features, sites with palaeoenvironmental records, finite or restricted rock exposures and fossils. Using this risk-based assessment, development of indicative geoheritage climate-change actions have been prioritised for these sites. Depending on the characteristics of the sites, management options may range from ‘do nothing’ to rescue excavations and posterity recording. Monitoring is an essential part of the management process to trigger evidence-based interventions.",

		"abstract": "Tertiary injectites, which are re-mobilized sandstones, represent commercially attractive targets for near-ﬁeld, long-reach tie-backs to existing ﬁeld infrastructure above and adjacent to producing reservoirs. Injectites exhibit exceptional porosity–permeability and productivity, such that discoveries can add incremental reserves and lift production decline in mature ﬁelds. Abundant injectites are visible on seismic data in the Tertiary of the Viking Graben, but, as some disappointing wells have established, not all are hydrocarbon-charged. The challenge is to reliably distinguish hydrocarbon-ﬁlled high porosity–permeability features from tight or dry reservoirs in a cost-effective way. Regional rock physics analysis of injectite reservoirs, using well data from ﬁelds in Norway and the UK, reveals that a combination of elastic attributes can effectively discriminate lithology and hydrocarbon presences in these reservoirs. After pre-stack conditioning, broadband seismic data correlate reliably with wells, giving conﬁdence that pre-stack seismic is faithfully imaging the elastic properties of the subsurface in lower Tertiary target intervals. Informed by rock physics analysis, a combination of broadband seismic elastic attributes is used to predict sand presence and de-risk hydrocarbon presence in reservoirs v. water-wet targets. Hydrocarbon sand distribution predicted from relative acoustic impedance and VP/VS matches to known accumulations and identiﬁes remaining near-ﬁeld opportunities.",

		"abstract": "On the island of Hopen, in the Svalbard Archipelago, the Svenskøya Formation is a succession 35 m in thickness, consisting primarily of sandstone beds and forming the youngest strata exposed on the island. We present a sedimentological and petrographic study of the formation and compare the unit with its exposures on Wilhelmøya and in Kong Karls Land, Svalbard. We also compare the onshore characteristics of the Svenskøya Formation with those of the Tubåen Formation, its time-equivalent unit in the Sentralbanken area of the northern Barents Sea. On Hopen, the Svenskøya Formation is interpreted as representing coarse clastic sediments deposited in a fluvial to tidal setting, prior to being overlain by a thin interval composed of tidal channel and marine shale deposits. The unit sits atop the regional “Rhaetian Unconformity” and represents sediments deposited during a regressive system that terminates at a flooding surface representing a local transgression of the palaeo-coastline. Petrographic studies show the formation as being arkosic, both on Hopen and in the Sentralbanken area. The reservoir quality of sandstone samples recovered from Hopen is somewhat lower compared to sandstone reservoirs in the Sentralbanken area. We attribute this to greater effects of diagenesis in the Hopen area, which caused increased compaction, mineral dissolution and extensive precipitation of pore-filling clay minerals.",

		"abstract": "Through-going joints cutting across beds are often invoked to match large-scale permeability patterns in tight carbonate reservoirs. However, despite the importance of these structures for fluid flow, only few field studies focused on the understanding and estimation of through-going joint dimensional parameters, including spacing and vertical extent in relation to stratigraphy. Recent improvements in the construction of digital models of outcrops can greatly help to overcome many logistic issues, favouring the evaluation of relationships between jointing and stratigraphy at the reservoir scale. In this study, we present the results obtained from integrating field measurements with a digital outcrop model of a carbonate platform reservoir analogue in the Sorrento peninsula (Italy). The outcrop consists of a nearly vertical cliff exposing a monocline of alternating gently-dipping shallow-water limestones and dolostones, crossed by several vertical joints of different size. This study allowed us to define how major through-going joints pass across thick beds (bed thickness > 30 cm), while they arrest against packages made of thinly stratified layers. In essence, through-going joints arrest on “weak” levels, consisting of thinly bedded layers interposed between packages made of thick beds, in the same manner as bed-confined joints arrest on less competent interlayers.",

		"abstract": "The Pont de Montanyana outcrop exposes strata of the lower Eocene Montllobat Formation deposited in alluvial plains and in meandering river systems of the Tremp-Graus piggyback basin (Southern Pyrenees, Spain). This article focuses on the characterisation of the outcrop using conventional descriptions (photomosaics, correlated stratigraphic logs and palaeocurrent data) together with 3D interpretations of digital outcrop models. The architectural elements identified include lateral-accretion deposits, channel fills (meandering, chute and distal alluvial-fan types), overbank sheets (wings and crevasse splay deposits) and floodplain fines. The channelised deposits were collectively classified, using the width (W) and thickness (T) ratio, as ribbons (W/T ≤ 15) to narrow sheets (W/T ≤ 100). Variations in sandstone/mudstone ratio (between 20% and more than 90% of sandstone) and in the internal architecture of the meandering channel fills suggest deposition in the abandoned channel at different times of the cut-off process and at different locations in relation to the position of the active channel. A high-resolution 3D facies model of the upper stratigraphic interval was constructed, containing point-bar deposits and an associated channel fill. The model was subsequently populated with petrophysical data representative of point-bar reservoirs. Flow simulations based on a water-injection development strategy were carried out. The flow behaviour and the distribution of the bypassed oil are determined by the high degree of internal heterogeneity in the meandering channelised deposits. This heterogeneity is produced by the facies variability, the inclined bedding of the lateral-accretion deposits, the lithology of the channel fill, the downstream fining along the bend and by the change in the orientation of the lateral-accretion surfaces due to expansion and rotation of the point bar. The moveable oil was effectively drained from the sandstone-dominated channel-fill body. However, more than 27% of the moveable oil remained trapped in the uppermost part of the lateral-accretion deposits.",

		"abstract": "The aim of this work is to reproduce a metre-scale facies heterogeneity 3D model of the Chattian Porto Badisco Calcarenite carbonate ramp outcropping in the Salento Peninsula (southern Italy). However, in shallow-water carbonate systems, capturing metre-scale facies heterogeneity in three-dimensional models remains controversial due to the possibility of facies coexistence and because their association can change through time and space. Within this context, the continuous and well-exposed Chattian Porto Badisco Calcarenite carbonate ramp allows detailed study of the distribution of lithofacies association and their architecture along the dip direction depositional profile. The lithofacies and the depositional model of the Porto Badisco Calcarenite are referred to those defined by Pomar et al. (2014). The Porto Badisco Calcarenite is a homoclinal carbonate ramp with a euphotic inner setting characterised by the extensive seagrass meadows, passing basinward into a large rotaliid packstone and coral mounds developed in mesophotic conditions. The deeper part of the oligophotic zone is characterised by rhodolithic floatstone to rudstone and large lepidocyclinid packstone. The distal part of the ramp is characterise by a fine calcarenite. The methodology used in this work combines classical field data collection (e.g., stratigraphic logs and field-facies mapping) and 3D stochastic modeling by using Petrel™. All the data (top and base of stratigraphic logs, cross-section, key surfaces, lithofacies lateral extension etc.) were georeferenced and inserted into the software to build the digital outcrop model. The 3D facies model has been performed after several simulations through specific stochastic algorithms (SISim, TGSim), comparing the models reproduce by the two algorithms, matching the depositional geometries and the lithofacies association observed in the outcrop. The 3D modeling represents a useful tool to better understand the facies architecture and their complex heterogeneity. Moreover, a detailed 3D facies model provides an essential tool to characterise semi-quantitatively sedimentological features for subsurface reservoir studies.",

		"abstract": "[Abstract The tectono‐stratigraphic evolution of rift systems is at present poorly understood, especially the one preceding the onset of oceanic seafloor spreading. Improving our understanding of the complex, polyphase tectonic evolution of the fossil Alpine Tethys, one of the best calibrated magma‐poor rift systems worldwide, offers great potential for the interpretation of the distal part of global rifted margins, which notoriously lack data. In this paper, we propose a tectono‐stratigraphic model for the former Alpine Tethys, whose remnants are exposed in the Alps of Western Europe. We first review the historical evolution of some concepts grounding present knowledge on the Alpine‐ and global magma‐poor rifted margins. Then we present a spatial and temporal template for the Alpine Tethys rift system using a ‘building block (BB)’ approach. This new approach is powerful in that it can integrate high‐resolution, structural, stratigraphic, thermochronological, and petrological observations from dismembered outcrops into a margin‐scale template compatible with the first‐order seismic architecture defined at present‐day, magma‐poor rifted margins. The detailed analysis of the syn‐rift sequence of the Alpine Tethys margins demonstrates that extension migrated and localised while evolving from the stretching to the necking phase. During hyperextension, rifting was asymmetric and controlled by in‐sequence detachment faulting. Then, the rift system evolved back into a more symmetric, embryonic spreading system. With this contribution, we aim to allow readers without knowledge of the Alps to access this unique ‘archive’ preserving some of the world&apos;s best‐exposed rift structures. Recognising these structures is critical to understand the origin of some new concepts used to explain present‐day, deep‐water rifted margins, and to interpret and predict the tectono‐stratigraphic evolution during advanced stages of rifting., We use a “building block” approach to build a spatio‐temporal template for the Alpine Tethys, which enables us to: upscale local structural, stratigraphic, thermochronological and petrological observations; develop a generic understanding of the rift system and its evolution; and use the Alpine “archive” to calibrate global margin processes. ]",

		"abstract": "Improvements in seismic imaging, computing capabilities, and analytical methods, as well as a number of industry deep-water wells sampling distal offshore settings, have underpinned new concepts for rifted margin evolution developed in the last two decades; these mark significant progress in our understanding of extensional systems. For example, the tectonic, sedimentary, and magmatic processes linked to the formation of rifted margins have been overhauled, giving rise to more quantitative approaches and new concepts. However, these processes cannot be understood in isolation, requiring consideration of the continuum in which inheritance and physical processes are integrated within a plate tectonic framework. The major progress and fundamental developments of past research in rifted margins have been made hand-in-hand with other domains of Earth Sciences and have fundamental implications for the understanding of key geological systems such as active rifts, the ocean lithosphere, subduction zones, and collisional orogens. The “IMAGinING RIFTING” workshop, organized in Pontresina-Switzerland in September 2017, gathered researchers from all disciplines working on rifts and rifted margins, and included participants from academia and industry. This contribution summarizes the workshop discussions, in addition to outlining our state-of-the-art knowledge of rifted margins. We highlight future challenges in unraveling the processes and conditions under which these extensional systems form and, ultimately, how tectonic plates rupture and new oceans are born. Our aims here are to provide a framework for future research endeavors and to promote collaboration not only within the rift and rifted margins communities, but across other Earth Science disciplines.",

The interpretations created by the test-panel were sorted into 10 scenarios characterized by different fault geometries. These scenarios were explored with 2(3)D point-spread function based convolution seismic modelling to investigate the potential of seismic data to image detailed fault architectures. The results reveal that: (1) Statistical analysis shows considerable variations between manually picked faults. (2) Identifying the location of fault tips is challenging and smaller antithetic faults are rarely recognizable. (3) Uncertainties arise from masking of closely spaced fault segments even where displacement values are large, showing distorted reflection signatures of apparent extensional fault tip monoclines. The distortion is larger for conventional versus high-resolution data. (4) In the conventional and high-resolution seismic data the vertical resolution of closely spaced reflections and small offset faults is 20 m and 5 m, respectively. (5) The utilisation of high-resolution seismic data, combined with seismic modelling, add confidence to interpretation of conventional seismic data in the same area. We conclude that subsurface fault mapping with seismic data requires insight in objective uncertainties associated with the data. Automatic machine-learning fault interpretation is void of subjective bias but still hampered by objective limitations. Further, a risking workflow requires acknowledgement of uncertainties that are transferred to seismic based fault analysis techniques such as juxtaposition analysis, quantitative fault seal analysis, and fault stability analysis.",

		"abstract": "On February 11, 2019, the latest batch of four Galileo satellites has been commissioned for operational use, accelerating the evolution of the Galileo system toward Full Operational Capability (FOC). To exploit the advantages of the European GNSS constellation, all the Galileo signals in the E1 and E5 frequency band have been successfully integrated in Leica GNSS positioning technologies, with the expectation of improved availability, accuracy and reliability. From the user’s perspective, this paper assesses the benefits of Galileo to high-precision GNSS in the real-time kinematic (RTK), real-time precise point positioning (PPP) and post-processing scenarios. Representative measuring conditions, such as open sky, multipath environments and tree canopy, are considered. The RTK results show that in challenging environments, the integration of Galileo significantly improves the RTK fix availability and effectively reduces decimeter-to-meter-level position errors caused by incorrect ambiguity fixes. To characterize the RTK performance of individual GNSS systems, Galileo-only positions are compared with GPS-only and GLONASS-only solutions. The PPP results demonstrate how Galileo benefits the convergence time and positioning accuracy. The post-processing studies show that the inclusion of Galileo provides more accurate solutions for short data durations and long baselines, particularly for data collected under strong multipath conditions.",

		"abstract": "Studies conducted in present-day magma-poor rifted margins reveal that the transition from weakly thinned continental crust (∼30 km) in proximal margins to hyper-extended crust (≤10 km) in distal margins occurs within a narrow zone, referred to as the necking zone. We have identified relics of a necking zone and of the adjacent distal margin in the Campo, Grosina and Bernina units of the fossil Alpine Tethys margins and investigated the deformation and sedimentary processes associated with extreme crustal thinning during rifting. Within the basement rocks of the necking zone, we show that: (1) Grosina basement represents pre-rift upper/middle crust, while the underlying Campo unit consists of pre-rift middle/lower crust that was exhumed and cooled below ∼300°C by ca. 180 Ma, when rifting started to localize within the future distal margin; (2) the juxtaposition of the Campo and Grosina units was accommodated by the Eita shear zone, which is interpreted as a decollement/decoupling horizon active at mid-crustal depth at 180–205 Ma; (3) the Grosina unit hosts a large-scale brittle detachment fault. Our observations suggest that crustal thinning, accommodated through the necking zone, is the result of the interplay between detachment faulting in the brittle layers and decoupling and thinning in ductile quartzo-feldspatic middle crustal levels along localized ductile decollements. The excision of ductile mid-crustal layers and the progressive embrittlement of the crust enables major detachment faults to cut into the underlying mantle, exhuming it to the seafloor. This structural evolution can explain the first-order crustal architecture of many present-day rifted margins.",

		"abstract": "The discovery of hyperextended crust in present-day magma-poor distal rifted margins has major implications for the development of rift concepts. Indeed, the occurrence of low-angle detachment faulting changes the structural style and modifies the classical architecture of rifted margins, often represented by tilted blocks and bounded by high-angle normal faults. At present, little is known about the ways in which detachment systems form in distal margins through time and space and the way in which they control the formation of supradetachment rift basins. In this paper, we discuss a Jurassic rift-related detachment system of the fossil Adriatic distal rifted margin, today exposed in the Lower Austroalpine Err nappe in SE Switzerland. A palinspastic restoration of the Alpine units places the three-dimensional postrift architecture of this detachment system over more than 200 km2 and 34 km in transport direction. Based on the description of a preserved supradetachment basin, we can show that the synrift sedimentary evolution records the formation of supradetachment extensional allochthons and the exhumation of basement rocks. Using this well-exposed example, we will show that detachment systems are intimately related to the overall tectono-sedimentary evolution of the most distal parts of the Adriatic rifted margin and possibly other Atlantic-type magma-poor hyperextended rifted margins.",

In this paper, we investigate mega fault-scarps and the sedimentary system located at their toe across magma-poor rifted margins. Our approach combines observations from subsurface examples along present-day margins and field analysis of fossil examples exposed in the Alpine Tethys margins. Whereas present-day examples of rifted margins imaged by seismic techniques provide details about the architecture of the top basement and the relationship between faults and sediments, outcrops give access to the sedimentary features of rocks related to mega fault-scarps. Our study shows that (1) mega fault-scarps are preferentially located at rift domain boundaries, implying a topographic escarpment that juxtaposes rift domains of different crustal thickness, and (2) mega fault-scarps are long-lived local sources for syn- and post-tectonic breccia, respectively produced during and after fault activity.",

		"abstract": "The Austroalpine nappes of Switzerland represent an exhumed and tectonically imbricated segment of the passive continental margin of the Jurassic Tethys. Within one of these nappes (Err nappe), part of an upper-crustal, extensional detachment is preserved, indicating that the thinning of the crust was achieved by non-uniform extension. The Mesozoic age of the detachment is shown by comparison between its associated cataclasites and identical cataclasites that are found as redeposited components in Middle(?) Jurassic sedimentary breccias. This low-angle detachment within the basement was kinematically linked to synsedimentary high-angle normal faults at the surface.The area of the Err nappe belongs, in terms of Jurassic paleogeography, to the most distal part of the continental margin, where both low- and high-angle normal faults dipped oceanward (that is, west to northwest in present-day coordinates). In the more proximal part of the margin, however, the high-angle normal faults dipped eastward toward the continent. Ammonite stratigraphy within the sediment prisms adjacent to the faults gives evidence for an Early Jurassic age of the faulting in the proximal part of the margin, whereas in the distal part, faulting occurred during latest Early to Middle Jurassic time. We therefore propose that the Jurassic extension of the crust, which finally led to the opening of the Piemont-Ligurian ocean, was achieved by two fault systems, which differ in geometry, fault orientation, and age. These fault systems were composed of a basal low-angle detachment with high-angle normal faults above.The orientation of the older, eastward-dipping detachment was prone for reactivation during early Alpine crustal shortening. The present-day thrust contact between the two major tectonic units of the area, the Lower Austroalpine and the Central Austroalpine nappe complex, therefore might correspond to an eastward-dipping, Jurassic low-angle normal fault.",

Here we describe one of the best preserved examples of a detachment system that is exposed over 200 km2 in the Err nappe in SE Switzerland. Based on existing and new mapping, we realized a new map that enables to describe the 3-D structure of a detachment system and its role in thinning the crust and controlling the architecture and structural evolution of a hyperextended margin. We show that the Err detachment system is formed by at least three in-sequence detachment faults. The 3-D architecture of these faults and of their hanging wall blocks is controlled by inherited structures and a prerift evaporite level. The geometrical relationships and the evolution of the detachment system show deviations from the classical rolling hinge model. From the observations it remains unclear how and where the detachment faults rooted at depth. The overall observations made in the Err nappe allow to describe how the final rift evolution preceding mantle exhumation can be explained by extensional detachment systems and how these structures shape the hyperextended continental wedge at distal margins. While these questions are difficult to answer at present-day rifted margins, the use of a kilometer-scale field analogue can help to upscale and to interpret extensional detachment systems at present-day distal, magma-poor rifted margins.",

		"abstract": "The break-up of continental lithosphere in magma-poor margins is accompanied by the exhumation of mantle and crustal rocks in the footwall of large-scale detachment faults. Although these structures have been described from many modern and ancient margins, little is known about how they accommodate strain and evolve in time and space during continental break-up. The Tasna Ocean–Continent Transition (OCT) in southeastern Switzerland is one of the rare examples where such detachment faults are exposed and can be observed on a kilometre scale. In this paper we describe the deformation structures and their evolution observed along detachment faults in the Tasna OCT. Our results show that continental break-up was attained by a series of detachment faults. These detachment faults accommodated extensional strain in fault zones formed by a localized core zone that is surrounded by a several tens to hundred metres wide damage zones. The core zone corresponds to the zone of highest strain and is well defined structurally by the occurrence of gouges and/or foliated cataclasites and physically by separating a hanging wall from a footwall. Deformation in the fault zones occurred under greenschist facies to seafloor conditions and within the stability field of serpentine. U/Pb ages on zircon from a garnet-bearing pegmatite cross cutting high-temperature shear zones (upper amphibolite facies and higher) provide Carboniferous ages and demonstrate that these shear zones are neither kinematically nor genetically related to the detachment faults observed in the Tasna OCT. Ar/Ar ages on phlogopite from spinel websterite suggest that mantle exhumation occurred during Middle Jurassic time. Our data show that the detachment faults observed in the Tasna OCT formed during latest rifting, post-date major thinning of the crust and onset of mantle serpentinization. These results compare well with those from the deep Iberia margin. Our observations support the idea that rifting leading to continental break-up is a multi-phase process, and that serpentinization is the consequence rather than the reason for strain localization at non-volcanic margins. Apart from the more general implications for the tectonic evolution of continental break-up, our results have some important consequences for the palaeogeographic reconstruction of certain Alpine domains and question the existence of an independent Early Cretaceous Valais ocean in the Alpine realm.",

		"abstract": "Magma-poor ocean-continent transitions at distal rifted margins record complex stratigraphic interactions engendered by extreme crustal thinning and mantle exhumation. The Tasna ocean-continent transition, exposed in the Middle Penninic Tasna nappe in eastern Switzerland, is so far the only known example where the lateral transition from continental crust to exhumed serpentinized mantle lithosphere is exposed and not overprinted by later Alpine deformation. This paper presents sedimentological, structural, and petrographical observations and detrital zircon provenance data to document: (1) the processes controlling continental hyperextension and mantle exhumation; and (2) the facies, depositional systems, sediment sources, delivery pathways, and depositional stacking patterns associated with magma-poor ocean-continent transitions. Our results show that the basement units of the Tasna ocean-continent transition are composed of prerift upper and lower crust and subcontinental mantle rocks juxtaposed as part of the continental crustal thinning process. The absence of pervasive, synrift deformation in the lower-crustal rocks indicates that the thinning was likely achieved by deformation along localized shear zones before being exhumed at the seafloor by brittle, late extensional detachment faulting and not by any form of lower-crustal flow.The age of the first sediments deposited on the continental crust and exhumed mantle, the so-called Tonschiefer Formation, is considered to be Late Jurassic. A key observation is that the restored morpho-tectonic and sedimentary evolution of the Tasna ocean-continent transition shows the intercalation of downdip, transported platform-derived sediments and along-axis–derived siliciclastic sediments originating from the recycling of prerift sediments, local basement, and/or extra-Alpine sources.",

Foliated gabbro, gabbro mylonite, and granitoid mylonite occurring along the LTD record shearing under decreasing temperatures. U–Pb dating of zircon from the gabbro mylonite yielded a Permian age, interpreted as the age of gabbro intrusion, whereas the breakup of the passive margin occurred as late as Early Cretaceous. This suggests that the gabbro belongs to a prerift, lower to middle crustal intrusion ‘smeared out’ along the detachment by extensional faulting. The juxtaposition of mantle and upper crust along the Lower Tasna detachment may serve as a model for several seismic reflectors observed in distal passive continental margins (e.g. S reflector of the Galicia margin).",

		"abstract": "The association of mafic extrusive rocks and serpentinized mantle rocks is a common feature encountered in numerous ultra-distal magma-poor rifted margins as well as in (ultra)slow-spreading oceanic settings where detachment faulting and mantle exhumation occur. Although seismic imaging and high-resolution TOBI radar allow imaging this association, the nature of this interface is poorly understood (e.g. nonconformity vs. tectonic channelized vs. diffuse fluid flow along the interface). The timing between magmatism and active detachment faulting is often poorly constrained and it remains difficult to decipher if mafic extrusives are pre-, syn- or post-exhumation of mantle rocks at the seafloor. In this study, we characterize the nature of this interface from a section of a Jurassic ultra-distal margin preserved in the Platta nappe, SE Swiss Alps. We show that the basalt-serpentinized mantle contact does neither correspond to an Alpine thrust system, nor to a nonconformity or a detachment plane exhuming mantle rocks from underneath already emplaced basalts. Rather, the basalt-serpentinite interface corresponds to a weak decoupling level formed by conjugate low-angle normal faults onto which conjugate high-angle normal faults branch. These structures are diagnostic of co-axial extensional tectonics occurring during and after emplacement of basalts over a formerly exhumed serpentinized mantle. Carbonate extensional and shear veins and foliated ophicalcites formed during this Jurassic extensional event. Their distribution across and along the basalt-serpentinite interface demonstrates that this decoupling interface was a high-permeability layer that channelized high fluid flow responsible for the widespread hydrothermal alteration. A positive feedback between fluid flow and extensional deformation is proposed.",

		"abstract": "Oceanic core complexes are the uplifted footwalls of very-large-offset low-angle normal faults that exhume lower crust and mantle rocks onto the seafloor at slow-spreading ridges. Although it is suggested on the basis of numerical modelling that they form during periods of relatively reduced magma supply, little is known about how they initiate and become inactive, nor why only certain normal fault systems develop into core complexes. In this paper we present results from a near-bottom sidescan sonar/bathymetric profiler survey and sampling study of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near 13°N that identify the critical controls on oceanic core complex development and evolution. We show that core complex detachment faults initiate as high-angle (65°±10°) normal faults no different from surrounding valley-wall faults and, like them, rapidly flatten to dips of ∼30° in response to flexural unloading; however, on certain structures slip continues rather than being relayed inward onto a new normal fault. Runaway displacement appears to be triggered primarily by local waning of magma supply below a critical threshold, then aided by strain localisation resulting from seawater penetration and talc formation along the fault zones. Spreading becomes markedly asymmetric when the core complexes are active, and volcanism is suppressed or absent. When the asymmetry is such that the detachments accommodate more than half the total plate separation the active faults migrate across the axial valley. As a consequence magma is emplaced into and captured by the footwall of the detachment fault rather than being injected into the hanging wall, explaining the frequent presence of gabbro bodies and other melt relicts at oceanic core complexes. Core complexes are ultimately terminated when sufficient magma is emplaced to overwhelm the detachment fault; in the 13°N area by neovolcanic ridges propagating laterally across them from magmatically robust segments along strike.",

		"abstract": "Core-complex formation driven by lithospheric extension is a first-order process of heat and mass transfer in the Earth. Core-complex structures have been recognized in the continents, at slow- and ultraslow-spreading mid-ocean ridges, and at continental rifted margins; in each of these settings, extension has driven the exhumation of deep crust and/or upper mantle. The style of extension and the magnitude of core-complex exhumation are determined fundamentally by rheology: (1) Coupling between brittle and ductile layers regulates fault patterns in the brittle layer; and (2) viscosity of the flowing layer is controlled dominantly by the synextension geotherm and the presence or absence of melt. The pressure-temperature-time-fluid-deformation history of core complexes, investigated via field- and modeling-based studies, reveals the magnitude, rate, and mechanisms of advection of heat and material from deep to shallow levels, as well as the consequences for the chemical and physical evolution of the lithosphere, including the role of core-complex development in crustal differentiation, global element cycles, and ore formation. In this review, we provide a survey of ∼40 yr of core-complex literature, discuss processes and questions relevant to the formation and evolution of core complexes in continental and oceanic settings, highlight the significance of core complexes for lithosphere dynamics, and propose a few possible directions for future research.",

		"abstract": "The developing asymmetry of rifting and continental breakup to form rifted margins has been much debated, as has the formation, mechanics and role of extensional detachments. Bespoke 3D seismic reflection data across the Galicia margin, west of Spain, image in unprecedented detail an asymmetric detachment (the S reflector). Mapping S in 3D reveals its surface is corrugated, proving that the overlying crustal blocks slipped on S surface during the rifting. Crucially, the 3D data show that the corrugations on S perfectly match the corrugations observed on the present-day block-bounding faults, demonstrating that S is a composite surface, comprising the juxtaposed rotated roots of block-bounding faults as in a rolling hinge system with each new fault propagation moving rifting oceanward; changes in the orientation of the corrugations record the same oceanward migration. However, in contrast to previous rolling hinge models, the slip of the crustal blocks on S occurred at angles as low as ∼20°, requiring that S was unusually weak, consistent with the hydration of the underlying mantle by seawater ingress following the embrittlement of the entire crust. As the crust only becomes entirely brittle once thinned to ∼10 km, the asymmetric S detachment and the hyper-extension of the continental crust only developed late in the rifting process, which is consistent with the observed development of asymmetry between conjugate magma poor margin pairs. The 3D volume allows analysis of the heaves and along strike architecture of the normal faults, whose planes laterally die or spatially link together, implying overlaps in faults activity during hyper-extension. Our results thus reveal for the first time the 3D mechanics and timing of detachment faulting growth, the relationship between the detachment and the network of block-bounding faults above it and the key processes controlling the asymmetrical development of conjugate rifted margins.",

		"abstract": "In spite of recent progress in the understanding of magma-poor rifted margins, the processes leading to the formation and evolution of the exhumed mantle domain and its transition toward steady state oceanic crust remain debated. In particular, the parameters controlling the progressive localization of extensional deformation and magmatic processes leading to the formation of an oceanic spreading center are poorly understood. In this paper, we highlight the occurrence of two major decoupling horizons controlling the structural and magmatic evolution of distal magma-poor rifted margins. They are marked by strong seismic reflectors located at about 1 s TWTT (Upper Reflectors–UR) and 2 s TWTT (Lower Reflectors–LR) below top basement in domains of exhumed mantle at several magma-poor rifted margins. Both reflection seismic observations and studies on the physical properties of serpentinized mantle suggest that the UR likely results from deformation localized along a rheological interface at about 3 km below top basement, associated with an abrupt change in the mechanical behavior of peridotites once they are serpentinized to ~15%. We suggest that this interface played a major role in successive fault re-organizations during formation of the exhumed mantle domain. The comparison of reflection seismic observations with Alpine field analogues suggests that the LR likely results from an interaction between magmatism, deformation and hydration reactions during final rifting. Based on our results, we suggest that during final rifting the strain distribution is controlled first by hydration and then by magmatic processes in the domain of exhumed mantle.",

Observations on rifted margins are now integrating an increasing amount of multi-channel seismic data and drilling of several Continent-Ocean Transitions. Based on large scale geometries and domains observed on high-quality multi-channel seismic data, this article proposes a classification reflecting the mechanical behavior of the crust from localized to diffuse deformation (strong/coupled to weak/decoupled mechanical behaviors) and magmatic intensity leading to breakup from magma-rich to magma-poor margins. We illustrate a simple classification based on mechanical behavior and magmatic production with examples of rifted margins. We propose a non-exhaustive list of forcing parameters that can control the initial rifting conditions but also their evolution through time. Therefore, rifted margins are not divided into opposing types, but described as a combination and continuum that can evolve through time and space.",

This paper reviews data and tectonic concepts derived from these two margins and proposes that extension, leading to thinning and final rupturing of the continental lithosphere, is accommodated by three fault systems, each of them characterized by a specific temporal and spatial evolution during rifting of the margin, by its fault geometry, and its surface response. The data presented in this paper suggest that margin architecture and distribution of rift structures within the future margin are controlled first by inherited heterogeneities within the lithosphere leading to a contrasting behaviour of the future distal and proximal margins during an initial stage of rifting. The place of final break-up appears to be determined early in the evolution of the margin and occurs where the crust has been thinned during a first stage to less than 10 kilometres. During final break-up, the rheology of the extending lithosphere is controlled by the thermal structure related to the rise of the asthenosphere and by serpentinization and magmatic processes.",

		"abstract": "The mechanism of continental extension and breakup, and the role of detachment faults in these processes, are currently the subject of intense debate. One possible detachment fault is the S reflector, imaged as an undulating (in time), locally discontinuous reflection on existing seismic profiles west of Iberia. Here we present new images in depth of the four margin-normal profiles across the west Galicia rifted margin, where the S reflector was originally defined and is best imaged. It is shown that faults bounding wedge-shaped units of late synrift sediments, which hence were active during rifting immediately prior to breakup, appear to detach at shallow levels onto the S reflector. S itself appears as a continuous, locally domal feature and does not generally appear offset. The waveform of S is compatible with a reflection from a single interface such as a sharp tectonic boundary. The depth sections show that S was active at 1–3 km below the seafloor during final rifting; S is interpreted as a brittle detachment fault which controlled the final breakup of the continent west of Galicia. Furthermore, the data provide constraints on the sense of shear of S: analogy with detachment terranes, the present, synrift and structural dips of S, and the identification of a breakaway to S imply that S accommodated top-to-the-west shear. Toward the east of the profiles, S becomes more complex, possibly because of different phases of detachment faulting and the development of both incisement and excisement structures. From the geometry of wedge-shaped sedimentary units deposited during faulting above S it also appears that S was active at an angle of 20° or less and hence may be considered a genuine low-angle normal fault.",

		"abstract": "This study focuses on the assessment of the stratigraphic architecture of the proximal and distal Jurassic Alpine Tethys rifted margins. The aim of the study was to reconcile the major observations performed in the Alps through time with what is observed in present-day magma-poor rifted margins. The proximal and distal rifted margins reflect two evolutionary phases of rifting involving different structures and isostatic evolutions leading to different stratigraphic records. The proximal rifted margins formed from Upper Triassic to Pliensbachian times and resulted in the formation of classical half graben basins. Rift evolution changed drastically during Pliensbachian to Toarcian times when extension started to localize in the future distal rifted margins. Low-angle detachment faults become the new elementary structure controlling final crustal tapering and eventually mantle exhumation to the sea floor. New structural elements controlling the stratigraphic architecture of the distal rifted margins include extensional allochthons and breakaway blocks, both resulting from the delamination of a keystone block, also referred to as hangingwall block, during hyper-extension processes. To define the stratigraphic architecture of the proximal and distal rifted margins, three stratigraphic marker horizons are used, namely the top of the pre-rift sequences, the top of the proximal margin syn-tectonic sequence and the base of post-rift sequences. Based on the distribution of these stratigraphic marker horizons across the Alpine units and a structural re-evaluation of the rift structures, a synthetic tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the Alpine Tethys domain is proposed that reconciles old and new ideas about how rift systems may evolve in space and time.",

The first oceanic floor that appeared between the divergent European and Apulian passive margins was made up of mantle-derived serpentinite and associated minor gabbro bodies; some of the ocean-floor gabbros were already foliated and metamorphosed to amphibolite facies. To explain these features, we suggest use of the model of Wernicke, which postulates a major, oblique, normal detachment fault that cuts across the lithosphere. The model explains some asymmetrical features on both sides of the preoceanic continental rift. An increase of the offset of the detachment fault may lead to the tectonic denudation of the upper mantle and thus give birth to an ultramafic ocean floor.",

		"abstract": "The discovery of exhumed continental mantle and hyper-extended crust in present-day magma-poor rifted margins is at the origin of a paradigm shift within the research field of deep-water rifted margins. It opened new questions about the strain history of rifted margins and the nature and composition of sedimentary, crustal and mantle rocks in rifted margins. Thanks to the benefit of more than one century of work in the Alps and access to world-class outcrops preserving the primary relationships between sediments and crustal and mantle rocks from the fossil Alpine Tethys margins, it is possible to link the subsidence history and syn-rift sedimentary evolution with the strain distribution observed in the crust and mantle rocks exposed in the distal rifted margins. In this paper, we will focus on the transition from early to late rifting that is associated with considerable crustal thinning and a reorganization of the rift system. Crustal thinning is at the origin of a major change in the style of deformation from high-angle to low-angle normal faulting which controls basin-architecture, sedimentary sources and processes and the nature of basement rocks exhumed along the detachment faults in the distal margin. Stratigraphic and isotopic ages indicate that this major change occurred in late Sinemurian time, involving a shift of the syn-rift sedimentation toward the distal domain associated with a major reorganization of the crustal structure with exhumation of lower and middle crust. These changes may be triggered by mantle processes, as indicated by the infiltration of MOR-type magmas in the lithospheric mantle, and the uplift of the Briançonnais domain. Thinning and exhumation of the crust and lithosphere also resulted in the creation of new paleogeographic domains, the Proto Valais and Liguria-Piemonte domains. These basins show a complex, 3D temporal and spatial evolution that might have evolved, at least in the case of the Liguria-Piemonte basin, in the formation of an embryonic oceanic crust. The re-interpretation of the rift evolution and the architecture of the distal rifted margins in the Alps have important implications for the understanding of rifted margins worldwide, but also for the paleogeographic reconstruction of the Alpine domain and its subsequent Alpine compressional overprint.",

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT We describe the tectono‐sedimentary evolution of a Middle Jurassic, rift‐related supra‐detachment basin of the ancient Alpine Tethys margin exposed in the Central Alps (SE Switzerland). Based on pre‐Alpine restoration, we demonstrate that the rift basin developed over a detachment system that is traced over more than 40 km from thinned continental crust to exhumed mantle. The detachment faults are overlain by extensional allochthons consisting of upper crustal rocks and pre‐rift sediments up to several kilometres long and several hundreds of metres thick, compartmentalizing the distal margin into sub‐basins. We mapped and restored one of these sub‐basins, the Samedan Basin. It consists of a V‐shape geometry in map view, which is confined by extensional allochthons and floored by a detachment fault. It can be restored over a minimum distance of 11 km along and about 4 km perpendicular to the basin axis. Its sedimentary infill can be subdivided into basal (initial), intermediate (widening) and top (post‐tectonic) facies tracts. These tracts document (1) formation of the basin initially bounded by high‐angle faults and developing into low‐angle detachment faults, (2) widening of the basin and (3) migration of deformation further outboard. The basal facies tract is made of locally derived, poorly sorted gravity flow deposits that show a progressive change from hangingwall to footwall‐derived lithologies. Upsection the sediments develop into turbidity current deposits that show retrogradation (intermediate facies tract) and starvation of the sedimentary system (post‐tectonic facies tract). On the scale of the distal margin, the syn‐tectonic record documents a thinning‐ and fining‐upward sequence related to the back stepping of the tectonically derived sediment source, progressive starvation of the sedimentary system and migration of deformation resulting in exhumation and progressive delamination of the thinned crust during final rifting. This study provides valuable insights into the tectono‐sedimentary evolution and stratigraphic architecture of a supra‐detachment basin formed over hyper‐extended crust.",

		"abstract": "The thinning of the crust and the exhumation of subcontinental mantle in magma-poor rifted margins is accompanied by a series of extensional detachment faults. We show that exhumation along these detachments is intimately related to migration of fluids leading to changes in mineralogy and chemistry of the mantle, crustal, and sedimentary rocks. Using field observation and analytical methods, we investigate the role of fluids in the fossil distal margins of the Alpine Tethys. Using Cr-Ni-V, Fe, and Mn as tracers, we show that fluids used detachment faults as pathways and interacted with the overlying crust and sediments. These observations allow us to discuss when, where, and how this interaction happened during the formation of the rifted margin. The results show that: (i) serpentinization of mantle rocks during their exhumation results in the depletion of elements and migration of mantle-reacted fluids that are channeled along active detachment system; (ii) in earlier-stages, these fluids affected the overlying syntectonic sediments by direct migration from the underlying detachments;(iii) in later-stages, these fluids arrived at the seafloor, were introduced into, or “polluted” the seawater and were absorbed by post tectonic sediments. We conclude that a significant amount of serpentinization occurred underneath the hyperextended continental crust, and that the mantle-reacted fluids might have modified the chemical composition of the sediments and seawater. We propose that the chemical signature of serpentinization related to mantle exhumation is recorded in the sediments and may serve as a proxy to date serpentinization and mantle exhumation at present-day magma-poor rifted margins.",

		"abstract": "Cordilleran detachment faults, as defined here, are extensional faults of low initial dip, probably less than 30°, and subregional to regional scale. Some detachment faults have large translational displacements, i.e., in excess of several tens of kilometers. First interpreted as Tertiary extensional structures in the eastern Great Basin by Armstrong (1972), they are now known to be widespread throughout those Cordilleran regions that have undergone greatest Cenozoic extension. Detachment faults are commonly, but not necessarily, associated with lower-plate mylonitic gneisses that compose the so-called “metamorphic core complexes.” Probably nowhere in the U.S. Cordillera are detachment faults more widely and spectacularly developed than in the region that borders the lower Colorado River in southernmost Nevada, southeastern California, and southwestern Arizona. We believe that our studies and those of numerous other workers in this region, the Colorado River extensional corridor of Howard and John (1987), provide a number of new perspectives on the origin, geometry, and evolution of Cordilleran detachment faults. Detachment faults are best explained as evolving shallow-dipping shear zones that have accommodated Tertiary crustal extension (Wernicke, 1981). The fault zones are believed to root at midcrustal or lower upper crustal depths into broad zones of intra-crustal flow, the tectonic regime in which mylonitic gneisses form. At their upper ends, major detachment faults either reach the surface directly or terminate at shallow depth into pull-apart complexes of closely spaced normal faults. Along these evolving shear zones, lower-plate mylonitic gneisses are drawn upward and out from beneath upper-plate rocks. As footwall gneisses rise structurally upward, they are retrograded, sheared, and shattered at progressively colder and shallower crustal levels to form the chloritic breccias and microbreccias characteristic of many major detachment faults. At advanced stages of detachment fault evolution, lower-plate mylonitic gneisses formed at depths &gt;12 km are tectonically juxtaposed beneath unmetamorphosed supracrustal rocks and exposed at the surface through combinations of crustal upwarping, tectonic denudation, and erosion. Contrary to popular belief, the master detachment faults exposed today are probably not in their entirety those faults that formed at the start of extensional deformation, but rather are only the youngest in a succession of major detachment faults. Detachment faults undergo warping at high angles to the direction of crustal extension, probably in large part related to isostatically induced distortions of originally more planar faults. Such warping leads to the development of younger, more planar fault splays that either cut upward into former upper-plate rocks (excisement) or downward into former lower-plate rocks (incisement). Recognition of such geometric complexities offers fresh insights into deciphering the evolving strain patterns within major detachment terranes. Studies in the Whipple Mountains region of southeastern California indicate that: (1) detachment faults have formed by both excisement and incisement tectonics; (2) northeast-southwest-trending “folds” of major detachment faults, oriented parallel to the direction of extension, are in reality primary corrugations or flutes in the fault surface (a conclusion previously reached by other workers in nearby areas); (3) most normal faults in the upper plates of major detachments originally had listric geometries before losing their flattened lower segments as the consequence of excisement tectonics; and (4) detachment faults can transect upper crustal rocks as primary, low-dipping shear zones without pre-existing, shallow-dipping structural controls (e.g., thrust faults) on their localization; the northeast-southwest-trending curviplanar geometry of the Whipple fault does, however, seem to mimic preexisting fold structure in lower-plate mylonitic gneisses crossed by the fault. Finally, the rate of translation along master faults of some evolving detachment systems apparently can be very rapid (&gt;1 cm/yr), much faster than rates that we (and perhaps other workers) once deemed reasonable. A very good case can be made on the basis of geochronologic and field studies that footwall mylonitic gneisses were transported upward along the Whipple detachment system from lower upper crustal depths to near surface levels in less than 2 m.y. (between 18 and 20 Ma).",

		"abstract": "The Cenozoic normal fault system exposed in the Chemehuevi Mountains of the southern Cordillera provides constraints on the initiation angle and geometry of an extensional fault system that has accommodated extreme crustal stretching. There, three stacked, brittle, low-angle normal faults that formed at depths as great as 10-12 km cut gently down section northeastward through deformed Proterozoic and Mesozoic crystalline basement. Hanging-wall blocks are displaced relatively northeastward. The upper crust above the Chemehuevi detachment fault was pulled apart along high-angle normal faults that rotated to more gentle dips through time. In contrast, rocks of originally mid-crustal affinity in the footwall were only gently rotated and accommodated minor extension (&lt;2%) by normal and strike-slip faulting, local ductile shearing, and dike emplacement. These relationships imply that the upper and middle crust as a whole extended nonuniformly. Structural constraints on the initiation angle of the detachment faults in the Chemebuevi Mountains are based on a wide variety of observations, including fault rock type and associated mineral deformation mechanisms, orientation and crosscutting relations of syntectonic dikes and faults, and the metamorphic grade of footwall rocks to the regionally developed normal fault system. In each case, the initial dip of the fault is limited to &lt;30°.Application of 40Ar/39Ar and fission-track thermochronology to rocks in the footwall of the Chemehuevi detachment fault system provides further constraints on the timing and initiation angle of regional detachment faulting. At the onset of extension between 22 and 24 Ma, granitic rocks exposed in the southwestern and northeastern portions of the footwall were at ∼200 °C and 350-400 °C, respectively, separated by a distance of some 23 km down the known slip direction. This gradual increase in temperature with original depth is attributed to the gentle southwest tilting of broadly planar pre-extension isothermal surfaces and constrains the exposed part of the Chemehuevi detachment fault to have had a regional dip initially of about 15° to 30°. The fault system apparently cut gently down through the upper crust, to a minimum depth of ∼10-12 km, the deepest exposed parts of the system today, and was domed from midcrustal depths and locally denuded during continued slip. Together the structural and thermochronologic data confirm the suggestion that faults accommodating large-magnitude slip can be initiated and move within the seismogenic regime at moderate to low angles (that is, ≤30°).",

		"abstract": "The ophiolites from the Alpine Tethys are incompatible with the definition of the classical 3-layered Penrose ophiolite sequence, but they also show features that are inconsistent with ultraslow-spreading ridge sequences or transform settings. The existence of pre-rift contacts between subcontinental mantle and continental crust, the association of top-basement detachment faults with continent-derived blocks (extensional allochthons) and tectono-sedimentary breccias overlying subcontinental mantle, and a post-rift sedimentary evolution identical to that of the adjacent distal margin enable to characterize some of the Alpine Tethys ophiolites as remnants of a former Ocean Continent Transition (OCT). Therefore, we propose that at least some of the Alpine Tethys ophiolites are formed by remnants of an ancient Magma-Poor-Ocean Continent Transition, referred to as a MP-OCT sequence. The type sequence consists of the Platta, Tasna and Chenaillet ophiolite units, the former two representing the OCT of the ancient Adriatic and European/Briançonnais conjugate rifted margins, the latter representing a more developed “oceanic” domain. All three units escaped Alpine subduction and preserve pre-Alpine contacts between exhumed basement and a volcano-sedimentary cover sequence. These units preserve the structural, magmatic, hydrothermal and sedimentary record of continental breakup and early seafloor spreading. The observations compare well with those made along the magma-poor Iberia–Newfoundland rifted margins, which are the only example in an OCT where drill holes penetrated into basement. At present, magma-poor rifted margins form up to 50% of all rifted margins worldwide. We argue that MP-OCT sequences are more common in the geological record but were, in part mistaken as either Mid Ocean Ridge or tectonically dismembered Penrose-type ophiolite sections.",
